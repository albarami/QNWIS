# QNWIS Architecture: Domain-Agnostic Ministerial Intelligence

**System:** Qatar National Workforce Intelligence System  
**Scope:** General-purpose intelligence for ANY ministerial topic  
**Design:** 15+ data sources + 4 specialist agents = comprehensive cross-domain analysis

---

## Why Domain-Agnostic?

Qatar's economic committee discusses:
- Health, Tourism, Food, Skills, Digital transformation
- Oil & Gas, Manufacturing, Logistics, Infrastructure
- Finance, Sports, NDS3, Workforce, and MORE

**Traditional approach:** Build separate systems for each domain ❌  
**QNWIS approach:** Single platform handles ALL domains ✅

---

## 15+ Data Sources Enable Cross-Domain Coverage

|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **World Bank** | Economic, All sectors | 128 cached indicators (GDP, infrastructure, health, education, etc.) |
| **IMF** | Economic, Fiscal | Dashboard (GDP growth, inflation, debt, fiscal balance) |
| **IEA** | Energy, Oil/Gas | Energy statistics, renewables, carbon emissions |
| **UNWTO** | Tourism, Hospitality | Tourism arrivals, revenue, employment |

## Example: Cross-Domain Analysis

**Query:** "Should Qatar invest QAR 20B in AI and tech sector by 2030?"

**Data Sources Called:**
- World Bank: Tech sector GDP contribution (economic)
- IEA: AI's role in energy efficiency (energy)
- Semantic Scholar: 10 papers on AI economic impact (research)
- GCC-STAT: Regional tech sector comparison (competitive)
- Perplexity: Real-time AI trends in Gulf (intelligence)

**Agent Perspectives:**
- Financial: "20B investment = 2% of GDP, ROI 15-year horizon, fiscal feasibility high"
- Market: "GCC AI race - UAE leads, KSA investing heavily, Qatar can differentiate in energy AI"
- Operations: "Talent gap critical - need 5,000 AI specialists, 10-year training pipeline required"
- Research: "Evidence shows AI boosts productivity 20-30%, but requires complementary investments"

**Debate Synthesis:**
Multi-perspective analysis combining economic, competitive, operational, and evidence-based insights.

**This SAME process works for:**
- Tourism investment decisions
- Healthcare infrastructure
- Food security strategies
- Manufacturing priorities
- Energy transition
- **ANY ministerial topic**

## Conditional Routing by Complexity (Not Domain)

The system routes by **query complexity**, not domain:

- **Simple:** "What is Qatar's tourism revenue?" → 3 nodes (fast)
- **Medium:** "Analyze tourism trends" → 10 nodes (comprehensive)
- **Complex:** "Should we invest 10B in tourism?" → 10 nodes + extended debate

**Works identically across ALL domains:**
- Simple health query → 3 nodes
- Complex health investment → 10 nodes + debate
- Simple energy query → 3 nodes
- Complex energy strategy → 10 nodes + debate

**Domain-agnostic routing ensures consistent depth regardless of topic.**

---

## Why This Matters for Ministerial Use

**Traditional approach:**
- Labor query → Labor system → Labor data only
- Tourism query → Tourism system → Tourism data only
- **Problem:** Siloed analysis, no cross-domain insights

**QNWIS approach:**
- Labor query → All relevant sources → Cross-domain insights (how does labor affect tourism? manufacturing?)
- Tourism query → All relevant sources → Cross-domain insights (how does tourism affect labor? economy?)
- **Benefit:** Holistic ministerial intelligence with cross-sector understanding

**Example:** "Evaluate Qatarization impact on tourism sector"
- Calls: ILO (labor), UNWTO (tourism), GCC-STAT (both), World Bank (both)
- Analyzes: Labor market + Tourism industry + Cross-sector impacts
- **Only possible with domain-agnostic architecture**

---

## Summary

**QNWIS is NOT:**
- A labor market system ❌
- A food security system ❌
- A single-domain tool ❌

**QNWIS IS:**
- A general-purpose ministerial intelligence platform ✅
- Handles ANY topic economic committee discusses ✅
- 15+ data sources for comprehensive coverage ✅
- 4 specialist agents for multi-perspective analysis ✅
- Cross-domain insights for holistic decision-making ✅

**"The system debates ANY strategic decision the economic committee might discuss."**

---

**Status:** Architecture validated as domain-agnostic  
**Scope:** Health, Tourism, Food, Skills, Digital, Oil/Gas, Manufacturing, Logistics, NDS3, Workforce, Finance, Infrastructure, Sports, Events, and ANYTHING else  
**Next:** Week 3 testing across ALL 15+ ministerial domains
