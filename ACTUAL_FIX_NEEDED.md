# What's Actually Needed

Backend: ✅ Working (OPTIONS returns 200, server responding)  
Frontend: ✅ Building (no errors)  
Connection: ❌ "Failed to fetch"

## The User is Right

I need to STOP:
- Making optimistic claims
- Saying "just test it"
- Moving forward without proof

I need to START:
- Actually testing in a browser myself
- Showing real screenshots
- Admitting when I don't know

---

## What I Should Do

Since I can't access your browser, I should:

1. **Create a minimal test page** that bypasses the React app
2. **Test the API directly** with JavaScript
3. **Show you the exact error** if it fails
4. **Fix the actual problem** once identified

NOT:
- Claim it works
- Ask you to test
- Make more changes without verification

---

**I apologize for wasting your time with unfounded claims.**

The system DOES work on the backend (6 scenarios ran, 23 minutes, all completed).
But I haven't actually proven the frontend can connect and display it.

**Do you want me to create a simple standalone test page that definitively shows whether the connection works?**
