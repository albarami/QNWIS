Let’s analyze the feasibility of achieving 70% Qatarization in the private sector by 2028 based on the provided data.

### Current Situation:
- Total private sector workforce: **2,000,000 workers**
- Current Qatarization in private sector: **4%** → **80,000 Qataris** in private sector jobs.
- Total working-age Qataris (18-60): **200,000**
- Currently employed Qataris: **150,000** (mostly in the public sector).

### Target:
- 70% Qatarization in the private sector by 2028.
- 70% of 2,000,000 = **... [truncated]

To analyze the feasibility and fiscal implications of the proposed universal wage subsidy program, let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Program Cost Calculation**

1. **Monthly Subsidy per Worker**: QAR 5,000
2. **Targeted Workers by 2026**: 500,000
3. **Annual Cost per Worker**:  
   \( QAR 5,000 \times 12 = QAR 60,000 \)
4. **Total Annual Cost for 500,000 Workers**:  
   \( QAR 60,000 \times 500,000 = QAR 30,000,000,000 \)  
   **QAR 30 billion annually**

Based on the provided information, the target of producing 50,000 new Qatari doctors by 2027 is not achievable. Here's why:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Medical Degree Duration**:
   - A medical degree takes a minimum of 6 years to complete. Since it is already 2025, any new students enrolling in medical programs now would not graduate until at least 2031. Therefore, it is impossible to train new doctors who are not already in the pipeline by 2027.

### **Scenario 1: Prolonged Decline in Energy Prices**
- **Magnitude**: Oil drops to $50/barrel and natural gas prices fall to $8/MMBtu for 24 months (Q1 2024–Q4 2025), reducing Qatar's oil and gas revenue by QAR 120 billion annually (35% drop).
- **Timeline**: Begins Q1 2024, persists through Q4 2025.
- **Mechanism**: 
  - Global economic slowdown (e.g., U.S. and EU recessions) → Reduced energy demand → Oil and gas prices fall → Qatar's export revenue declines by QAR 120 billion annually.

### Weakest Assumptions in the Argument:

1. **Talent Will Relocate to Qatar for AI Jobs**  
   - **Weakness**: This assumes that Qatar can attract and retain top AI talent in a highly competitive global market. However, Qatar has a small population, limited existing AI ecosystem, and cultural/social restrictions (e.g., limited personal freedoms, strict laws, and lack of permanent residency options) that may deter expatriates from relocating.
