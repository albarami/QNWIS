Even with optimistic growth and graduate inflows, the total Qatari workforce cannot exceed ~250,000, most of whom are already in the public sector. The target exceeds demographic capacity by roughly 5\u00d7.\n\n### Recommended Alternative\nSet a realistic target of 12\u201314% Qatarization by 2028, focusing on high-value sectors (finance, energy, ICT) and improving retention and skill alignment. This would require ~220,000 Qataris total workforce participation, within demographic limits.\n\n### Why This Matters\nBefore investing analytical resources in HOW to achieve a target, we must first verify IF the target is achievable. This query failed the basic arithmetic check - the required numbers exceed what is physically possible given Qatar's demographic constraints.\n\n### Recommendation\nDo NOT proceed with policy analysis for this target. Instead:\n1. Revise the target to be demographically feasible (5-8% economy-wide OR sector-specific targets)\n2. Conduct analysis on the revised, achievable target\n3.
