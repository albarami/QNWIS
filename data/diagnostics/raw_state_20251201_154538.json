Mathematical feasibility of 20% target\n2. Labor shortage thresholds\n3. Comparison with UAE Emiratization (7.2%) and Saudi Saudization (19.1%)\n4. Key drivers of successful Qatarization\n5. Recommended target with probability of success\n\n\n### First-Principles Assessment\n\n**Verdict: INFEASIBLE**\n\nAchieving 20% Qatarization by 2028 would require approximately 370,000 Qataris in the private sector, but only 70,000 at most are available. Even with optimistic growth (2.1% annually and 4,500 new graduates per year), the Qatari workforce could reach roughly 50,000\u201360,000 by 2028, far below the required number. The entire working-age Qatari population (~250,000) cannot support this scale without collapsing public sector employment.\n\n### Arithmetic Analysis\nAchieving 20% Qatarization by 2028 would require approximately 370,000 Qataris in the private sector, but only 70,000 at most are available. Even with optimistic growth (2.1% annually and 4,500 new graduates per year), the Qatari workforce could reach roughly 50,000\u201360,000 by 2028, far below the required number. The entire working-age Qatari population (~250,000) cannot support this scale without collapsing public sector employment.\n\n### Recommended Alternative\nTarget 12\u201314% Qatarization by 2028, focusing on high-value sectors (finance, energy, ICT) and improving retention. This aligns with demographic limits and regional benchmarks (UAE 7%, Saudi 19%).\n\n### Why This Matters\nBefore investing analytical resources in HOW to achieve a target, we must first verify IF the target is achievable. This query failed the basic arithmetic check - the required numbers exceed what is physically possible given Qatar's demographic constraints.\n\n### Recommendation\nDo NOT proceed with policy analysis for this target. Instead:\n1. Revise the target to be demographically feasible (5-8% economy-wide OR sector-specific targets)\n2. Conduct analysis on the revised, achievable target\n3.
