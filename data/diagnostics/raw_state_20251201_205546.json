Analyze:\n1. Cost per calorie comparison\n2. Resilience under crisis scenarios\n3. Water and energy requirements\n4. Speed of implementation\n5. Long-term sustainability\n\n\n### First-Principles Assessment\n\n**Verdict: INFEASIBLE**\n\nQatar\u2019s land and water constraints make large-scale domestic food production physically and economically prohibitive. Even with QAR 10 billion investment, desalination and energy costs would make local production far more expensive than imports. Achieving 70% vegetable and 40% protein self-sufficiency would require massive water and energy inputs exceeding sustainable limits.\n\n### Arithmetic Analysis\nQatar\u2019s land and water constraints make large-scale domestic food production physically and economically prohibitive. Even with QAR 10 billion investment, desalination and energy costs would make local production far more expensive than imports. Achieving 70% vegetable and 40% protein self-sufficiency would require massive water and energy inputs exceeding sustainable limits.\n\n### Recommended Alternative\nOption B (Strategic Reserve & Diversified Imports) is more feasible: build 2-year food reserves, secure farmland abroad, and diversify import routes. Domestic production can focus on high-value or perishable items (e.g., dairy, select vegetables) for resilience rather than full self-sufficiency.\n\n### Why This Matters\nBefore investing analytical resources in HOW to achieve a target, we must first verify IF the target is achievable. This query failed the basic arithmetic check - the required numbers exceed what is physically possible given Qatar's demographic constraints.\n\n### Recommendation\nDo NOT proceed with policy analysis for this target. Instead:\n1. Revise the target to be demographically feasible (5-8% economy-wide OR sector-specific targets)\n2. Conduct analysis on the revised, achievable target\n3.
