The role of expatriates across these sectors is significant, offering a nuanced understanding of their contribu7ons to the na7on's development[1]. Addi7onally, the challenges faced by Qatar's youth in securing employment opportuni7es have been well- documented, despite their educa7onal and skill preparedness[1]. Furthermore, the increasing significance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the labor market has been recognized, with these en77es ac7ng as key drivers of employment and economic diversifica7on[6]. 3.

Result 1. Background of the Qatar Labor Market: Situated on the Arabian Peninsula, Qatar has undergone a significant metamorphosis in its socio-economic landscape, largely driven by its labor market dynamics. Historically anchored by its rich hydrocarbon reserves, the na7on\u2019s economic fabric has been woven through the flourishing oil and gas sectors[2]. This wealth in natural resources has been a catalyst for unprecedented infrastructural and economic strides, asrac7ng a diverse array of foreign labor to meet the escala7ng demand. The result is a dis7nct demographic tapestry, with expatriates making up a staggering near 95% of the workforce, shaping a labor market that is uniquely Qatari in its composi7on and complexi7es [Qatar Open Data Portal] [1].", "source": "R&D Report: Report_Comprehensive Overview of Qatar's Labor Landscape-Insights from Recent Publications.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Report_Comprehensive Overview of Qatar's Labor Landscape-Insights from Recent Publications.pdf", "doc_type": "labor_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "labor_market", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 18, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Report_Comprehensive Overview of Qatar's Labor Landscape-Insights from Recent Publications.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "labor_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ad3275ee93db", "text": "demographic tapestry, with expatriates making up a staggering near 95% of the workforce, shaping a labor market that is uniquely Qatari in its composi7on and complexi7es [Qatar Open Data Portal] [1]. This heavy reliance on expatriate labor, while instrumental in driving growth, has also sown seeds of challenges. Issues surrounding integra7on, rights, and the long-term sustainability of such a labor model have been focal points of discussion, both na7onally and interna7onally[3][7]. Responding to these challenges, the Qatari government has ini7ated a series of reforms and strategies aimed at enhancing labor condi7ons and diversifying the economic landscape, laying the groundwork for a more balanced and sustainable labor market[2][7]. 2. Current State of the Labor Market: Fast-forward to the present, Qatar's labor market is a reflec7on of both its historical journey and its future aspira7ons. With an employment-to-popula7on ra7o of 87.5% and a labor force par7cipa7on rate of 88.3% in 2022, the current state of the labor market underscores a vibrant economic ac7vity and a high level of workforce engagement [ILO STAT].

Introduction: Defining a Dual-Track System 1.1 Core Concept: Rationale and Modern Framework In Qatar and the broader Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, a strategic imperative exists to increase the private sector participation of national citizens without compromising economic competitiveness (Waxin and Bateman 2015; International Labour Organization (ILO) 2024; Ministry of Labour (MoL) 2024a). This drive is a central component of long-term national strategies, including Qatar National Vision 2030, which prioritize the development of national human capital to build a sustainable, knowledge-based economy (Schnepfleitner and Ferreira 2021; QatarEnergy 2024). However, research indicates that simplistic policy responses, such as merely increasing the proportion of national employees to meet quotas, can be insueicient and may negatively impact organizational performance (Fatima and Elbanna 2025). This creates a central tension for firms: how to accelerate the development of national leaders while simultaneously maintaining operational productivity. To navigate this complex challenge, organizations are increasingly adopting sophisticated human resource architectures.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1a4e41fe5f24", "text": "of national leaders while simultaneously maintaining operational productivity. To navigate this complex challenge, organizations are increasingly adopting sophisticated human resource architectures. The dual- track talent system, the focus of this report, is one such strategic model, designed specifically to resolve this tension. 1.1.1 Historical Origins: The Dual Ladder The concept of a dual-track system originates from the \u201cdual ladder\u201d model, which emerged in the 1950s to solve a critical business challenge (Shepard 1958; T. J. Allen and Katz 1986). In an era of rapid technological innovation, companies needed to retain their top technical and scientific experts to stay competitive. The traditional corporate structure, however, oeered only a single path for advancement: management. This forced many highly skilled individual contributors into managerial roles they neither wanted nor were suited for, simply to gain higher pay and status, thereby wasting their valuable technical talents (T. J. Allen and Katz 1986). The dual ladder was created as an \u201calternative technical career path to management\u201d to resolve this dilemma (Deval 2024; Shepard 1958). It was built on the distinction that managers \u201cmake a profession of deciding,\u201d whereas technical experts \u201cmake a profession of knowing\u201d (Deval 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b931f039d8c5", "text": "resolve this dilemma (Deval 2024; Shepard 1958). It was built on the distinction that managers \u201cmake a profession of deciding,\u201d whereas technical experts \u201cmake a profession of knowing\u201d (Deval 2024). The structure\u2019s purpose was to build a dedicated pool of specialized talent that could drive innovation by allowing experts to advance without leaving their technical domain (Gilbert et al. 2018). The ideal was to create two parallel and equally rewarding career tracks (Tucker, Moravec, and Ideus 1992). In practice, however, many early systems failed because the technical track often lacked the genuine prestige, influence, and rewards of the managerial path. It was frequently perceived as a \u201cconsolation prize\u201d for those not suited for management, which de-motivated the very employees it was designed to retain (T. J. Allen and Katz 1986).

It concentrates developmental experiences, such as intensive training, cross-functional rotations, and dedicated mentoring, to build specific, predefined competencies and compress the time-to-readiness for leadership (Kakemam and Liang 2023). The National Graduate Development Program at QatarEnergy, which utilizes Individual Development Plans (IDPs), exemplifies this approach (QatarEnergy LNG n.d.). \u2022 The General Track: The standard pathway for individual contributors and experienced professionals, governing entry, development, and promotion for the broader workforce (T.

First, the system is a direct response to the \u201cPeter Principle,\u201d which posits that firms tend to promote employees based on their performance in their current role, rather than their aptitude for a new one (Benson, Li, and Shue 2019). This dual structure mitigates the risk of creating ineeective managers by establishing a formal mechanism to identify and cultivate managerial potential, rather than simply rewarding past performance in a non-managerial role. Second, this model is particularly well-suited to the demands of nationalization. It allows private employers to build a robust pipeline of national leaders in a structured, competency-based manner, thus satisfying national policy goals (Forstenlechner et al. 2011).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9e21159b8dc1", "text": "tionalization.

Simultaneously, by maintaining a general track for experienced hires (often expatriates), firms can preserve immediate operational delivery and leverage valuable firm-specific knowledge that external hires would lack (Bidwell 2011). This structure enables firms to invest strategically in a national leadership pipeline without taking on the prohibitive cost of sacrificing current performance (Fatima and Elbanna 2025).

An ILM is an administrative unit where the pricing and allocation of labor are governed by internal rules rather than by external market forces (Doeringer and Piore 2020). ILMs are characterized by three core features: job ladders with clear progression paths, ports of entry that are confined primarily to the bottom of these ladders, and the upward movement of employees through promotions based on the progressive development of skills (Pfeeer and Cohen 1984).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2a392347fca3", "text": "ts of entry that are confined primarily to the bottom of these ladders, and the upward movement of employees through promotions based on the progressive development of skills (Pfeeer and Cohen 1984). Seminal empirical work by Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (1994) on a single firm confirmed the existence of many of these features, noting stable hierarchies and lengthy, multilevel careers, though it also found that entry into the firm was not strictly limited to the lowest levels. This structure serves a critical economic function by creating a framework for on-the-job human capital acquisition and learning (Gibbons and Waldman 1998). By creating stable, long-term employment relationships, ILMs encourage both the firm and the employee to invest in \u201cfirm- specific skills.\u201d These are the knowledge and abilities that are more valuable to the current employer than to other firms. For the firm, the ILM is a mechanism to develop and retain a specialized talent pool, reducing the costs associated with external hiring and ensuring operational continuity. For the employee, the job ladder provides a clear pathway for career advancement and wage growth. Critically, however, the wage progression within an ILM is not always straightforward. For instance, Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (1994) found that while promotions were central to long-term wage growth, the immediate pay premiums from a promotion were often modest compared to the large dieerences in average pay between job levels.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_79e6c7041ab2", "text": "4) found that while promotions were central to long-term wage growth, the immediate pay premiums from a promotion were often modest compared to the large dieerences in average pay between job levels. This suggests that the primary benefit of a promotion is gaining access to a higher-level salary band where the potential for future earnings is greater. The \u201cfast track\u201d for nationals in the dual-track model can be understood as a highly structured and accelerated ILM designed to expedite this process of firm-specific skill and leadership development for a targeted group. Broader empirical studies suggest that the features of pure ILMs are not universal, with their prevalence varying by industry and firm characteristics (Eriksson and Werwatz 2004), which highlights that a dual-track system is often a deliberate strategic choice to construct an ILM to secure its benefits. 1.2.2 Tournament Theory: The Motivational Engine While ILMs provide the structure, tournament theory explains the motivational dynamics that drive performance within that structure. A promotion system can be modeled as a \u201crank-order tournament,\u201d where employees compete for a limited number of higher-level positions, and the \u201cprize\u201d is the promotion itself (Lazear and Rosen 1981).

The eeectiveness of a tournament hinges on the \u201cprize spread\u201d: the dieerence in compensation between levels must be significant enough to motivate employees to exert the high level of eeort required to compete and win (Connelly et al. 2014). Page 5 of 47 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 22nd, 2025 In a dual-track system, the accelerated promotions on the fast track serve as a significant prize. However, as noted by Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (1994), the \u201cprize\u201d is not merely the immediate pay raise but the long-term earnings potential that promotion unlocks. This aligns with tournament theory\u2019s prediction that large pay dieerentials are necessary to motivate eeort. A key advantage of tournaments is their ability to filter out \u201ccommon shocks,\u201d such as random events like economic downturns that aeect all employees equally, resulting in a fairer assessment of relative eeort (Green and Stokey 1983; Whitford 2018). Contemporary research makes a critical distinction between explained pay dispersion (based on performance) and unexplained pay dispersion (perceived as favoritism).

A recent field experiment powerfully confirms this: a more meritocratic promotion system increased worker productivity by 22%, and a steeper pay progression (a larger prize) boosted productivity only within the meritocratic system. In the non-meritocratic system, a steeper pay progression decreased productivity by 27%, suggesting it was perceived as unfair (Deserranno, Kastrau, and Le\u00f3n-Ciliotta 2025). 1.2.3 Organizational Justice: Ensuring Perceived Fairness For a tournament-based ILM to be productive, it must be perceived as fair by all employees. Organizational justice theory demonstrates that employees\u2019 perceptions of fairness strongly correlate with performance, cooperation, and commitment (Colquitt 2001). These perceptions are rooted in social exchange theory, which posits that the employment relationship consists of informal, reciprocal obligations between employees and the organization (Konovsky and Pugh 1994).

Employees distinguish between performance-based criteria (e.g., skill, eeort) and nonperformance-based criteria (e.g., favoritism, identity) (Webster and Beehr 2013). When employees perceive that promotions are awarded based on performance, it reinforces their sense of \u201cpromotional justice\u201d and builds trust (Beehr et al. 2004; Cropanzano, Bowen, and Gilliland 2007; Webster and Beehr 2013). This fosters a positive social exchange, where employees reciprocate fair treatment with higher commitment (Kebede and Wang 2022).

Firms frequently adopt dual-track systems to meet both horizons. The central question is one of design: under what conditions can such a two-track coexistence raise inclusion without lowering productivity?

This imperative stems from a demographic and economic structure unique to the region, characterized by a citizen population that is a minority in its own country and a historical reliance on the public sector for national employment. Data shows that non-nationals constitute up to two-thirds of the total labor force and, in some cases, over 95% of the private sector workforce (Wagle 2024). In Qatar, for instance, the percentage of nationals in the private sector labor force has remained below 10% in recent years (National Planning Council (NPC) 2025). This structure is a legacy of a \u201csocial contract\u201d where oil revenues funded extensive public sector jobs for citizens, which oeered higher wages, greater job security, and better benefits than the private sector (Assaad 2014; Forstenlechner et al. 2011). This social contract has created a deeply rooted preference for public sector employment, which is often perceived as more prestigious and less demanding (Wilkins 2001; Rutledge and Al Kaabi 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 18, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5885fa3abb59", "text": ".

These policies, broadly termed \u201cGulfization,\u201d mandate that firms in specific sectors achieve a minimum percentage of national employees (OECD, ADBI, and ILO 2024). Prominent examples include Saudi Arabia\u2019s Nitaqat program and the UAE\u2019s sector-specific targets, which have been the most binding and strictly enforced in the region (Elsayed 2024; Wagle 2024; Al-Horr 2011).

This makes it challenging for private firms to shift away from a reliance on expatriate workers without incurring significant costs (Erumban and Al-Mejren 2024). \u2022 Negative Firm-Level Outcomes: Strict quota enforcement can impose high costs on firms, particularly the most productive ones.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3f02b2a60a08", "text": "rkers without incurring significant costs (Erumban and Al-Mejren 2024). \u2022 Negative Firm-Level Outcomes: Strict quota enforcement can impose high costs on firms, particularly the most productive ones. Evidence from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Nitaqat policy shows that it led to an increased likelihood of market exit, a reduction in exports, and a decrease in the total workforce for firms that were below the quota, demonstrating the real economic trade-oes involved (Peck 2017; Basahal, Forde, and MacKenzie 2023; Cort\u00e9s, Kasoolu, and Pan 2021). One study estimated that the Nitaqat program caused 11,000 firms to shut down in its first 16 months (Peck 2017). \u2022 Supply-Side and Skills Mismatch: Firms report persistent dieiculties in recruiting national candidates due to a mismatch between the skills supplied by the education system and the needs of the private sector (Wilkins 2001; Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020). Key challenges include a lack of relevant technical skills, insueicient work readiness, high compensation expectations set by the public sector, and a perceived lack of \u201cvocationally orientated motivation\u201d (Waxin et al. 2018; Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2024; Forstenlechner et al. 2011).

The dual-track talent system, the focus of this report, has emerged as a strategic human resource architecture designed specifically to resolve this tension. 2. Pros & Cons: Speedy Local Leadership vs. Team Resentment and Knowledge Gaps 2.1 Benefits: A Well-Designed System A well-designed dual-track talent system allows an organization to balance the immediate need for operational eeiciency (exploitation) with the long-term imperative of developing new capabilities (exploration) (Hansen, G\u00fcttel, and Swart 2017). The system provides a structured mechanism to resolve the tension between leveraging the skills of the broader, often expatriate, workforce for current performance and cultivating a pipeline of national leaders for future innovation and sustainability. 2.1.1 Leadership Pipeline: Building a Sustainable National Cohort The primary benefit of a dual-track system is its ability to create a predictable and sustainable pipeline of national supervisors and specialists for pivotal roles.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 23, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6833b0d65c7b", "text": "ing a Sustainable National Cohort The primary benefit of a dual-track system is its ability to create a predictable and sustainable pipeline of national supervisors and specialists for pivotal roles. Global Talent Management (GTM) literature emphasizes the systematic identification of key strategic positions and the development of a talent pool to fill them (Collings, Mellahi, and Cascio 2018; Caligiuri et al. 2024). The \u2018fast track\u2019 serves as a dedicated mechanism for this, using structured rotations, targeted training, and mentorship to build firm-specific human capital (FSHC) in promising national employees. These programs act as credible signals of long-term commitment, which are essential for motivating employees to invest in acquiring such organization-specific skills (Raeiee and Coe 2016). For example, QatarEnergy\u2019s leadership development programs such as \u201cActivate\u201d for new graduates and \u201cCadre\u201d for emerging leaders are designed to provide exactly these kinds of structured, competency-based developmental experiences (QatarEnergy LNG 2023). Research confirms that such developmental job assignments are directly associated with the acquisition of critical managerial competencies (Dragoni et al. 2009).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 24, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0852ce523343", "text": "l experiences (QatarEnergy LNG 2023).

A case study of a leadership program in Qatar found that success factors included having a respected selection process and a deep awareness of the participants\u2019 professional and cultural contexts, reinforcing that eeectiveness is tied to thoughtful design (Schnepfleitner and Ferreira 2021). This internal development ensures a ready supply of well-trained workers who understand the company\u2019s unique culture and processes. Functioning like a modern apprenticeship system, this internal talent pipeline is more eeective than relying on the external market; studies show that internally promoted employees perform significantly better for their first two years than external hires (Bidwell 2011). The economic benefits of such a pipeline reduce the high costs and performance risks associated with external recruitment for critical positions, a point underscored by the high costs associated with employee turnover in general (Lerman 2014; Hom et al. 2017). This directly supports the goals of Qatar\u2019s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which aims to create jobs requiring highly experienced skills and enable the private sector to drive economic growth (Council of Ministers Secretariat General n.d.; Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA) 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_80afbdf6b88b", "text": "o create jobs requiring highly experienced skills and enable the private sector to drive economic growth (Council of Ministers Secretariat General n.d.; Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA) 2024).

A large-scale study on the reasons employees choose to stay with their organizations found that high-performing employees are particularly motivated by advancement opportunities and organizational prestige, precisely what a well-designed fast-track system provides (Hausknecht, Rodda, and Howard 2009). The clear, competency-gated structure provides \u201cCareer Success Criteria Clarity,\u201d which is empirically linked to higher career satisfaction and person-job fit (Xin et al. 2020). When employees perceive opportunities for career growth, including progress toward their goals and professional skill development, their turnover intentions decrease significantly (Weng and McElroy 2012). This addresses a key challenge in nationalization eeorts, where a perceived lack of genuine opportunities can lead to low motivation (Forstenlechner et al. 2011).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1c5ac378206d", "text": "gnificantly (Weng and McElroy 2012). This addresses a key challenge in nationalization eeorts, where a perceived lack of genuine opportunities can lead to low motivation (Forstenlechner et al. 2011). Furthermore, specific socialization practices common in fast-track systems, such as formal training, mentoring, and coaching, are empirically shown to facilitate the successful integration of nationals into the workforce (Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020). Such dual-track systems are also essential for retaining valuable technical experts who may not desire a traditional managerial career, thereby catering to diverse career orientations within the workforce (Bigliardi and Dormio 2009). 2.1.3 Organizational Resilience: Balancing Present Demands and Future Needs A dual-track system makes an organization more resilient by allowing it to navigate the competing institutional pressures of the GCC region (Sidani and Ariss 2014). The general track maintains operational continuity by using experienced hires for today\u2019s needs, which avoids the productivity dips that can accompany nationalization quotas (Hertog 2014). Simultaneously, the fast track builds a cohort of agile national leaders through diverse assignments and job rotation, a practice proven to increase workforce flexibility and performance (see \u00a73.3.1 for design and evidence).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e541bb67e4d3", "text": "track builds a cohort of agile national leaders through diverse assignments and job rotation, a practice proven to increase workforce flexibility and performance (see \u00a73.3.1 for design and evidence). This structured approach creates a \u201cstable pipeline of talent\u201d that is adaptable to market changes, ensuring the organization has the leadership it needs for future challenges (OECD 2022). The key to this structure is its close alignment with industry needs, a principle established by international competency standards which ensure the skills being developed are relevant and valuable (ILO 2006). Qatar\u2019s national policies provide a strong foundation for this approach. For example, the Ministry of Labour\u2019s \u201cOccupational Description and Classification Guide for the Private Sector\u201d establishes a clear, national framework of defined job titles and skill levels (MoL 2024b). This guide allows companies to build their talent pipelines with confidence, knowing their internal training is benchmarked against oeicial standards that are directly responsive to the evolving labor market. 2.1.4 Employer Brand: Projecting Strength and Authenticity Finally, a substantive and well-governed dual-track system strengthens a company\u2019s employer brand in the highly competitive national graduate market.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fea48ad1ab22", "text": "loyer Brand: Projecting Strength and Authenticity Finally, a substantive and well-governed dual-track system strengthens a company\u2019s employer brand in the highly competitive national graduate market.

A transparent, merit-based fast-track system moves beyond tokenism by signaling a credible and meaningful commitment to developing national leaders (Zeeane and Kemp 2020). This authenticity enhances both dimensions of the employer brand image, fostering more favorable attitudes among potential applicants and shaping their beliefs about desirable job attributes, such as career growth and development opportunities (Collins and Stevens 2002).

When the credibility of the system falters, it can depress motivation, create skill deficits, and harm organizational performance. The primary risks cluster around four interrelated failure modes: perceived favoritism, readiness gaps, morale issues among non-fast-track stae, and counterproductive responses to quota pressure. 2.2.1 Perceived Favoritism: The Meritocracy Paradox A core risk is that the fast track for nationals is perceived as a pathway based on identity rather than merit. This perception of favoritism fundamentally undermines organizational justice, a principle shown to be central to employees\u2019 satisfaction and commitment (Martin and Bennett 1996).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 30, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_48f34552b5a5", "text": "rather than merit.

When employees feel excluded or believe promotion processes are unfair, their motivation and performance sueer (Luo et al. 2023). Even when organizations implement formal, merit-based policies, a \u201cperformance-reward bias\u201d can emerge, whereby women and minorities receive less compensation or fewer opportunities than their male counterparts, despite having identical performance evaluation scores (Castilla 2008). In a dual-track system, this bias can manifest if managers, influenced by conscious or unconscious stereotypes, award smaller salary increases or fewer developmental opportunities to expatriates on the general track compared to nationals on the fast track, even when performance evaluations are equal. This perceived inequity erodes organizational trust and procedural justice. Indeed, meta-analytic evidence confirms that such perceptions of unfairness are strongly correlated with negative outcomes like stress, burnout, and turnover intentions (Bedi and Schat 2013).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 31, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_73072f141008", "text": "ustice. Indeed, meta-analytic evidence confirms that such perceptions of unfairness are strongly correlated with negative outcomes like stress, burnout, and turnover intentions (Bedi and Schat 2013). Research confirms that a \u201cprocedural justice climate,\u201d a shared group-level belief about the fairness of procedures, is a critical factor in team performance (Naumann and Bennett 2002). Employees clearly distinguish between performance-based promotion criteria (e.g., skill, eeort) and non- performance-based criteria (e.g., favoritism, identity). When promotions are seen as stemming from the latter, it undermines the legitimacy of the entire system, leading to resentment and reduced motivation (Webster and Beehr 2013). This can lead to resentment not just from the Page 11 of 47 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 22nd, 2025 expatriate workforce but also from nationals on the general track who perceive the system as unfair. This can devolve into what is known regionally as \u201cphantom employment,\u201d where nationals are hired simply to fulfill a quota without being integrated into a substantive role, the most extreme form of identity-based advancement over merit (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e0170ff24142", "text": "nationals are hired simply to fulfill a quota without being integrated into a substantive role, the most extreme form of identity-based advancement over merit (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2024). 2.2.2 Readiness Gaps: Competency and Training Transfer Deficits A poorly designed fast-track system can accelerate promotions without ensuring the parallel development of competencies, creating a \u2018readiness gap.\u2019 This occurs when titles are awarded based on tenure in a program rather than demonstrated skills, leading to quality lapses, control failures, and a loss of productivity (Benson, Li, and Shue 2019; Elbanna and Fatima 2022). This risk is particularly acute in contexts with a recognized \u2018education-employability gap,\u2019 where the skills supplied by the education system do not align with the needs of the private sector (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2024). This gap is a problem of \u2018training transfer.\u2019 Even when training is provided, its successful application on the job is not automatic. It requires a supportive environment, particularly from supervisors, to translate learning into performance (Hughes et al. 2020; Blume et al. 2023). If a dual-track system is merely a \u201cpaper exercise\u201d focused on compliance, an approach characterized as \u201cimplicit avoidance\u201d by some firms in Qatar, it will lack the robust mentorship and work-led learning needed to close these readiness gaps (Al-Horr 2011).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bf3cfaef71f1", "text": "on compliance, an approach characterized as \u201cimplicit avoidance\u201d by some firms in Qatar, it will lack the robust mentorship and work-led learning needed to close these readiness gaps (Al-Horr 2011).

If the fast- track is perceived as an opaque, unfair, or closed system, it can lead to significant morale issues. Research shows that perceptions of interpersonal and procedural injustice are powerful triggers for negative outcomes. One of the most damaging consequences is \u201cknowledge hiding,\u201d an intentional attempt by an employee to withhold or conceal knowledge that has been requested by another person (Cao 2022). This behavior stems from a breakdown in organizational trust and is considered a form of counterproductive work behavior (Bedi and Schat 2013).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 34, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_82ec8ea1ed95", "text": "e that has been requested by another person (Cao 2022). This behavior stems from a breakdown in organizational trust and is considered a form of counterproductive work behavior (Bedi and Schat 2013). Research based on the theory of relative deprivation provides a specific mechanism for this: when employees feel they are personally disadvantaged compared to their peers, their willingness to share knowledge within their team decreases. Procedural injustice, in particular, has been shown to fuel this sense of individual relative deprivation, which in turn mediates the negative eeect on intra-team knowledge sharing (Wan et al. 2023). Applying this psychological principle to the dual-track context, if experienced expatriates perceive the system as unjust and develop a sense of relative deprivation, they may become unwilling to share their crucial tacit knowledge with the national talent they are supposed to be mentoring. By undermining the informal mechanisms of on-the-job learning and knowledge transfer, this reaction not only harms immediate productivity but also directly sabotages the core objective of the fast-track system: building a capable and experienced local leadership pipeline.

Sector cases in banking, telecom, and public finance illustrate that balanced staeing, which involves continuing experienced recruitment while national cohorts mature, stabilizes delivery.

This involves moving beyond vague appraisals to a structured system of competencies, objective behavioral indicators, and multi-faceted assessments. 3.1.1 The Foundation: Designing Competency-Based Frameworks The architectural foundation of a robust milestone system is a well-defined competency model. Unlike traditional job analysis, competency modeling is fundamentally strategic, designed to influence employee behavior and align it with the organization\u2019s goals (Sanchez and Levine 2009). A competency is a collection of knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) needed for eeective performance, defined in a way that links directly to organizational strategy and distinguishes dieerent levels of performance (Campion et al. 2011). According to best practices, each competency within the framework should have a clear \u201canatomy\u201d: a descriptive title, a definition in behavioral terms, and clearly defined levels of proficiency.

This structure transforms a milestone from a vague checkpoint into a measurable demonstration of specific, required capabilities. The use of tools like Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS), which provide concrete behavioral examples for dieerent levels of performance, is one practical method for creating the objective and transparent scoring rubrics this system requires (Klieger et al. 2018). Research on executive-level promotions shows that professionally conducted Assessment Centers (ACs) have incremental predictive validity over and above standard cognitive tests, confirming they measure unique managerial abilities and performance attributes (Krause et al. 2006). This approach is increasingly being adopted in the region, often pioneered by large-scale public sector initiatives that set the standard for modern talent management. These government systems, designed as part of broader national development strategies, signal a clear direction for how human capital is to be managed. For instance, Qatar\u2019s \u201cAdaa\u201d performance management system and the UAE\u2019s Employee Performance Management System (EPMS) for federal employees both incorporate competency frameworks as a core component of evaluation (Civil Service and Government Development Bureau (CGB) n.d.; Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) n.d.; Government of the UAE 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 41, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8cd03e362c25", "text": "cy frameworks as a core component of evaluation (Civil Service and Government Development Bureau (CGB) n.d.; Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) n.d.; Government of the UAE 2020). Private sector firms, particularly those competing for national talent, often look to these frameworks as a benchmark for their own HR systems. 3.1.2 Milestone Design: Ensuring Objectivity and Observability For a dual-track system to be perceived as fair, progression criteria must be based on performance, not identity or favoritism. The rigor of a milestone lies in its objectivity and observability (Boon, Hartog, and Lepak 2019). Progression should be tied to the demonstration of specific behavioral indicators for each competency level. This principle is increasingly embedded in regional governance, setting a clear benchmark for best practices in talent management that extends to the private sector. For example, Qatar\u2019s public sector governance, through Act No. 15 (2016) on human resources and the national \u201cKawader\u201d e-recruitment portal, is founded on the principle of merit-based appointment and promotion based on performance evaluations (State of Qatar 2016; United Nations 2024; Sultanate of Oman 2007).

These principles are essential for upholding organizational justice and channeling the motivational power of tournaments across the workforce (see \u00a71.2.2 for the underlying theory). Research confirms that when employees perceive fairness in processes, they are more likely to accept outcomes, which is critical for maintaining the motivation of those on the general track (Ray 2023). 3.2.1 Procedural Justice: Ensuring Fairness Through Transparency Transparency in a dual-track system means that the criteria for assessment, the mechanics of promotion, and the pathways for career progression are explicit, objective, and clearly communicated to all employees. This is foundational to establishing promotional justice, which is the perception that the promotion system is fair (Webster and Beehr 2013). Research confirms that transparency is a direct antecedent of procedural justice, leading to higher levels of perceived fairness, which in turn enhances intrinsic motivation (Garc\u00eda-Izquierdo, Moscoso, and Page 17 of 47 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 22nd, 2025 Ramos-Villagrasa 2012; Wenzel, Krause, and Vogel 2017).

This approach is increasingly being adopted in Qatar through government systems like \u201cAdaa\u201d and programs at major national employers like QatarEnergy (CGB n.d.; QatarEnergy 2021; QatarEnergy 2025). (For competency model design, see \u00a73.1.1.) 3.2.2 Talent Motivation: Retaining Engagement Through Permeability A permeable and fair system requires robust mechanisms for both identifying high-potential talent and ensuring that promotion decisions are made without bias (the justice mechanism is summarized in \u00a73.2.1). Permeability is the principle that the fast-track must remain an open, contestable pathway rather than a closed system. Talented and motivated employees on the general track must have opportunities to enter the accelerated stream at defined intervals. This facilitates a \u201ccontest-based\u201d form of career mobility, as opposed to a closed \u201csponsorship- based\u201d system that can be perceived as patronage (Webster and Beehr 2013; Malau and Sitinjak 2024). A key mechanism for identifying employees who could \u201ctest into\u201d the fast track is their on-the-job behavior. Research shows that employees who actively seek out challenging job experiences or demonstrate discretionary \u201cextra-role\u201d behaviors (such as helping colleagues) are consistently rated by supervisors as more promotable (De Pater et al. 2009; Le Sante, Eaton, and Viswesvaran 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 48, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_90057bec4451", "text": "r demonstrate discretionary \u201cextra-role\u201d behaviors (such as helping colleagues) are consistently rated by supervisors as more promotable (De Pater et al. 2009; Le Sante, Eaton, and Viswesvaran 2021). A permeable system creates formal processes to recognize these signals, a process often enabled by active sponsorship and a high-quality supervisor-employee relationship (Kim and Holzer 2014; Malau and Sitinjak 2024). To ensure these promotion decisions are transparent and merit-based, leading organizations increasingly use \u201ccalibration committees.\u201d These committees, typically composed of a manager\u2019s peers and senior leaders, review and discuss performance ratings and promotion nominations for a given department (Grabner, K\u00fcnneke, and Moers 2020). By requiring managers to justify their ratings in front of peers, these committees create a strong incentive for objectivity and mitigate the biases of individual managers. This is supported by clear appeal routes, which provide an additional layer of procedural fairness. 3.2.3 Calibration Committees: A Mechanism for Procedural Fairness To ensure that promotion decisions are transparent and merit-based, leading organizations increasingly use \u201ccalibration committees.\u201d These committees, typically composed of a manager\u2019s peers and senior leaders, review and discuss performance ratings and promotion nominations for a given department or division (Grabner, K\u00fcnneke, and Moers 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 49, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b75c682d30b5", "text": "es, typically composed of a manager\u2019s peers and senior leaders, review and discuss performance ratings and promotion nominations for a given department or division (Grabner, K\u00fcnneke, and Moers 2020). This process serves as a powerful tool for procedural justice by mitigating the biases of individual managers and ensuring that performance standards are applied consistently across the organization (Bol, Margolin, and Schaupp 2025). Calibration committees directly address the risk of perceived favoritism in a dual-track system. By requiring managers to justify their ratings in front of peers, these committees create a strong incentive for objectivity. Research from a professional services firm shows that calibration committees eeectively discipline supervisors for opportunistic behavior (e.g., inflating their subordinates\u2019 ratings) by lowering the supervisors\u2019 own performance ratings. Conversely, supervisors who demonstrate skill by providing dieerentiated and informative ratings (i.e., using the full rating scale rather than compressing all ratings at the top) are rewarded with a higher likelihood of promotion (Grabner, K\u00fcnneke, and Moers 2020).

The presence of a committee also forces supervisors to engage more deeply with performance information rather than relying on cognitive shortcuts or prior biases (Bol, Margolin, and Schaupp 2025). 3.2.4 Data Disclosure: A Tool for Upholding Transparency Modern transparency extends beyond internal processes to include the disclosure of human capital data, a practice increasingly expected under global standards for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting (International Finance Corporation (IFC) 2025). International organizations like the OECD and ILO are actively promoting pay transparency as a tool to close gender pay gaps, establishing a global norm for data disclosure as a means of ensuring fairness (OECD 2021; ILO 2022). For a dual-track system in the GCC, this principle can be adapted to mandate the collection and disclosure of data on key outcomes, such as promotion rates, pay levels, and workforce representation by nationality at dieerent levels of the organization. Disclosing such data serves two purposes. First, it provides a mechanism for corporate accountability, allowing stakeholders (including investors, regulators, and employees) to monitor the firm\u2019s commitment to its stated nationalization and meritocracy goals (IFC 2016).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 51, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0982034eb710", "text": "m for corporate accountability, allowing stakeholders (including investors, regulators, and employees) to monitor the firm\u2019s commitment to its stated nationalization and meritocracy goals (IFC 2016). Second, it reinforces the integrity of the system by demonstrating that pathways to leadership are genuinely open. Reporting these metrics aligns with international best practices and frameworks like the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which recommend disclosure on human capital management policies and performance (OECD 2023a). This practice helps build trust and validates the fairness of the talent system, moving beyond \u201cceremonial adoption\u201d to genuine, data-backed commitment (Sidani and Ariss 2014). 3.2.5 Perceived Fairness: The Role of Manager-Employee Relationships While system-level transparency is crucial, its eeects can be significantly influenced by the relationship between an employee and their direct supervisor. The quality of this relationship is a key antecedent for the acceptance of performance appraisal systems (Kim and Holzer 2014). Research on organizational justice demonstrates that an employee\u2019s perception of fairness is formed at multiple levels, distinguishing between the organization as a whole and their specific department or team (Johnson et al. 2009).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 52, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_32ccfc2de34a", "text": "ce demonstrates that an employee\u2019s perception of fairness is formed at multiple levels, distinguishing between the organization as a whole and their specific department or team (Johnson et al. 2009). In many cases, the fairness of the local, departmental environment is a more powerful predictor of employee performance and cooperative behaviors than the perceived fairness of the broader organization. The quality of the leader-member exchange (LMX), which encompasses the trust, respect, and mutual obligation in the relationship between a manager and a direct report, acts as a critical bueer. Line managers are the \u201clink pin\u201d between intended policies and practice, and their support is a key mechanism through which talent management initiatives translate into improved performance (Kravariti et al. 2022; Garc\u00eda-Izquierdo, Moscoso, and Ramos-Villagrasa 2012). When LMX is high, employees are more likely to trust their manager and, by extension, the organization, making them less sensitive to perceived procedural unfairness. A high-quality relationship can compensate for the negative eeects of a system that is otherwise seen as unfair. Conversely, when LMX is low, employees become highly attuned to procedural justice; in this context of low trust, the formal transparency and fairness of the system become paramount to sustaining motivation and performance (Johnson et al. 2009).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 53, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ea235168ceb0", "text": "highly attuned to procedural justice; in this context of low trust, the formal transparency and fairness of the system become paramount to sustaining motivation and performance (Johnson et al. 2009).

For a dual-track system to successfully accelerate the development of national talent without being perceived as an unfair \u201cpaper exercise,\u201d the modality of development must be fundamentally grounded in the realities of the workplace. This principle of work-led learning, which combines structured on-the-job experience with targeted theoretical instruction, is validated by extensive research. A comprehensive meta- analysis by Burke et al. (2006) found that training methods requiring active participation, such as behavioral modeling and hands-on practice, are significantly more eeective for knowledge acquisition and behavioral improvement than passive methods like lectures or videos.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 54, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_62212f072031", "text": "ve participation, such as behavioral modeling and hands-on practice, are significantly more eeective for knowledge acquisition and behavioral improvement than passive methods like lectures or videos. More recent meta-analytic work on job-embedded professional development confirms that models such as coaching and mentoring yield positive outcomes for teachers and students, supporting their implementation and expansion (Balta, Fukkink, and Amendum 2023). Studies of apprenticeship systems in England and Germany, for instance, demonstrate that this dual approach yields significant positive returns in employment and earnings, largely because it builds practical, transferable skills that are directly valued by the market (Cavaglia, McNally, and Ventura 2020; Riphahn and Zibrowius 2015). In the Gulf context, where a key challenge is bridging the gap between academic qualifications and the specific needs of the private sector, a work-led modality is not just beneficial but essential (Darwish et al. 2022; Rutledge and Al Kaabi 2023). 3.3.1 On-the-Job Learning: The Primacy of Structured Experience The most eeective training programs hinge on active, learner-centric delivery methods (Raeisinafchi et al. 2025).

The \u201cfast track,\u201d therefore, must be designed around a core of structured, on-the-job experiences. This aligns with the \u201cdual system\u201d model of apprenticeships prominent in countries like Germany, which combines practical on-the-job training with theoretical education (Riphahn and Zibrowius 2015), a model whose relevance in the Arab region is underscored by recent reviews of work-based learning programs (Billett 2019). A core component of this model is structured rotational assignments across key business units, such as profit-and-loss, operations, and risk/compliance, which serve as the primary vehicle for learning. Job rotation serves three critical functions in a dual-track system: (1) \u201cemployee learning,\u201d as it speeds up skill acquisition and human capital development; (2) \u201cemployer learning,\u201d as it allows the firm to learn more about an employee\u2019s dieerent competencies and thus improve the quality of job-matching; and (3) \u201cemployee motivation\u201d (Ortega 2001; Eriksson and Ortega 2006).

A meta-analysis of 56 studies confirmed that job rotation is significantly associated with outcomes like job satisfaction, career success, and labour flexibility (Mlekus and Maier 2021; Shahiri, Husin, and Khain 2023; OECD 2023b). Furthermore, a longitudinal study in the financial services industry found that while lateral moves were more frequent among low performers, the employees who benefited most in subsequent performance were the high performers who had been rotated (Kampk\u00f6tter, Page 20 of 47 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 22nd, 2025 Harbring, and Sliwka 2016). This suggests that rotation, when used selectively, is a powerful developmental tool for fast-track employees. 3.3.2 Learning Transfer: The Role of Mentoring and Coaching Work experience alone does not guarantee development; it must be supported by deliberate mechanisms for reflection and learning transfer. Mentorship is a critical component for facilitating this process. A meta-analysis confirms that mentoring is consistently associated with a wide range of positive outcomes for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including favorable behavioral, attitudinal, and career outcomes such as higher compensation and greater satisfaction (T. D. Allen et al. 2004; Eby et al. 2008).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 57, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d4585fbe55a7", "text": "ge of positive outcomes for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including favorable behavioral, attitudinal, and career outcomes such as higher compensation and greater satisfaction (T. D. Allen et al. 2004; Eby et al. 2008). In a dual-track system, each fast-track employee should be assigned a mentor- of-record who is accountable for translating on-the-job experiences into tangible learning. This moves beyond informal guidance to a structured relationship focused on performance. A systematic review on workplace-based assessment found that providing credible, systematic feedback is a key driver of performance improvement, and that this process is often enhanced by facilitation or coaching (Miller and Archer 2010). Further meta-analytic evidence confirms that social support, from both supervisors and peers, is a powerful predictor of motivation to transfer learning to the workplace (Reinhold, Gegenfurtner, and Lewalter 2018). While mentoring focuses on overall career and skills development, coaching is typically more short-term and focused on improving performance in a current or specific task (Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) 2020). Meta-analytic evidence demonstrates that coaching programs have large positive eeects on instructional practice and smaller, but still positive, eeects on achievement (Kraft, Blazar, and Hogan 2018).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 58, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f78cad9e8433", "text": "Meta-analytic evidence demonstrates that coaching programs have large positive eeects on instructional practice and smaller, but still positive, eeects on achievement (Kraft, Blazar, and Hogan 2018). A mentor\u2019s role is to help the trainee make sense of their experiences, clarify goals, navigate organizational processes, and build crucial interpersonal relationships (Carlock 2012). This structured support, which a study in Qatar identified as a key component of informal workplace learning alongside team-based knowledge sharing (Al-Hajri 2024), is essential for ensuring that the developmental journey is intentional and that learning from diverse rotations is integrated eeectively. Local research in Qatar\u2019s healthcare sector highlights practical challenges, such as the confusion between mentoring and direct supervision (Suliman et al. 2018) and the significant workload burden placed on preceptors (Varghese et al. 2023), underscoring the need for well-structured and properly resourced mentorship programs. 3.3.3 Validation: Using Simulation-Based Assessments and Rater Calibration To ensure the credibility of the fast-track and uphold organizational justice, progression cannot be based on tenure.

Such assessments test judgment, stakeholder communication, and decision-making under pressure, providing more objective evidence of competence than a standard performance review. The principle of using systematic, observable, and simulation-based exercises to evaluate on-the-job competencies is supported by extensive research in various professional fields (Miller and Archer, 2010). Common formats include exercises styled after assessment centers, a methodology that meta-analytic research has repeatedly confirmed is valid for predicting career advancement (Gaugler et al. 1987), and low-fidelity simulations such as Situational Judgement Tests (SJTs), which are a valid and construct-driven method for assessing competencies like leadership and dependability (Christian, Edwards, and Bradley 2010; Olaru et al. 2019).

However, the credibility of the assessment hinges on the credibility of the assessors. If managers use dieerent standards to evaluate performance, the system\u2019s fairness is compromised. Research on \u201cFrame-of-Reference\u201d training demonstrates that the accuracy and fairness of performance ratings can be significantly improved by training managers to share a common conceptual framework, or \u201cschema,\u201d of what constitutes eeective performance (Gorman and Rentsch 2009). For a dual-track system to be perceived as a meritocracy, managers and mentors must be trained to apply a single, consistent competency framework to all employees, ensuring that promotion decisions are, and are seen to be, based on demonstrated ability, not track status. 3.4 Implementation Levers: Incentives and Manager Accountability For a dual-track system to succeed, it is not enough to simply design two pathways; the system must be powered by a coherent set of incentives and robust accountability mechanisms.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 61, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_97126bc38dd0", "text": "ger Accountability For a dual-track system to succeed, it is not enough to simply design two pathways; the system must be powered by a coherent set of incentives and robust accountability mechanisms. This ensures that managers and employees on both the fast track and the general track are motivated to engage productively. A central challenge, particularly for managers on the general track, is the incentive to invest time and eeort in developing national talent who may eventually be promoted ahead of them. Without clear incentives, these managers might resort to knowledge hiding or deprioritizing mentorship, thereby undermining the entire system. Therefore, rewards, accountability, and the very definition of managerial performance must be explicitly aligned with the dual-track objectives. 3.4.1 Incentive Design: Balancing Tournament and Team Goals A dual-track system inherently creates an incentive structure that can be understood through the lens of \u201ctournament theory,\u201d where accelerated promotion on the fast track serves as a significant \u201cprize\u201d (Lazear and Rosen 1981). This theoretical model helps explain the powerful motivational eeect of such a system. However, applying this model also highlights inherent risks. First, using promotion as a primary incentive for current performance can lead firms to prioritize top performers over candidates with the best managerial potential, an outcome consistent with the \u201cPeter Principle\u201d (Benson, Li, and Shue 2019).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 62, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9d517fdadac9", "text": "e for current performance can lead firms to prioritize top performers over candidates with the best managerial potential, an outcome consistent with the \u201cPeter Principle\u201d (Benson, Li, and Shue 2019).

While the \u201cprize\u201d of fast-track promotion motivates high-potential nationals, a component of managerial bonuses should be tied to the overall performance of the team or business unit.

This provides a clear regulatory foundation for designing incentive systems that reward not just individual achievement but also collaborative, productivity-enhancing behaviors that support the dual-track model. 3.4.2 Manager Accountability: Focusing on Process over Outcome For incentives to be eeective, they must be linked to clear accountability. In the context of HR, it is useful to distinguish between two types of accountability focus: process and outcome (Hewett et al. 2024). \u2022 Process Accountability involves holding managers accountable for how they implement HR practices. In a dual-track system, this means assessing whether managers are actively engaging in the required developmental activities, such as providing regular coaching, conducting performance reviews, oeering mentorship, and assigning challenging \u201cstretch\u201d assignments. \u2022 Outcome Accountability focuses on holding managers accountable for the final results of these practices, such as whether a national employee achieves a promotion within a specific timeframe.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 64, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_dba9e4d157fc", "text": "ments. \u2022 Outcome Accountability focuses on holding managers accountable for the final results of these practices, such as whether a national employee achieves a promotion within a specific timeframe. While outcomes are important, an excessive focus on them can create pressure for managers to take shortcuts, whereas a focus on process encourages more thoughtful, high-quality developmental interactions (Hewett et al. 2024). For a dual-track system to build a sustainable pipeline, managerial accountability must emphasize process. Managers should be evaluated on their coaching skills and their commitment to developmental activities. Research confirms that skillful managerial coaching is a key driver of team performance and knowledge building (Nyfoudi et al. 2023). This process focus is particularly crucial because feedback tools alone are insueicient; research shows a significant number of managers never download their 360-degree feedback reports unless a coaching or follow-up process is mandated (Bracken, Rose, and Church 2016). Successful nationalization frameworks explicitly engage expatriate stae in the socialization and development of national citizens, holding them accountable for these process- oriented activities (Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020). Furthermore, a focus on process aligns with new policy directions in the region.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 65, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_97a424eb3333", "text": "t of national citizens, holding them accountable for these process- oriented activities (Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020). Furthermore, a focus on process aligns with new policy directions in the region. For example, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD) in Saudi Arabia now mandates that establishments with over 50 employees disclose their training data and plans annually, holding them accountable for the process of workforce development (HRSD 2025). Finally, accountability systems must be designed with objective criteria to mitigate unconscious biases, such as the tendency for managers to give higher ratings to subordinates they perceive as being more similar to themselves (Turban and Jones 1988). 3.4.3 Promotability: A Non-Financial Incentive for Mentoring While financial incentives are important, a powerful non-financial incentive for managers on the general track to mentor and develop junior talent is the impact of these activities on their own Page 23 of 47 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 22nd, 2025 career progression.

Research confirms that managers who provide career-related mentoring to their direct reports are, in turn, perceived by their own bosses and peers as being more promotable (Gentry and Sosik 2010). Similarly, employees who take on challenging job experiences are seen by supervisors as having higher advancement potential, independent of their current job performance (De Pater et al. 2009). Meta-analytic reviews confirm that workplace coaching is an eeective tool for improving learning and performance outcomes, justifying its central role in such developmental programs (Jones, Woods, and Guillaume 2015; Cannon-Bowers et al. 2023). By coaching, mentoring, and delegating challenging tasks, managers demonstrate crucial leadership competencies such as talent development, strategic thinking, and the ability to build eeective teams. OECD reports on apprenticeships likewise emphasize the importance of building capacity for in-company trainers and supervisors as a pillar of a successful system (OECD 2018). This creates a virtuous cycle. The organization signals that people development is a valued leadership competency, and managers with a strong \u201clearning orientation\u201d recognize that investing in their team members is a direct investment in their own career advancement (Dragoni et al. 2009). This is a critical mechanism for ensuring that experienced expatriate and national managers on the general track actively champion the development of high-potential nationals on the fast track.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 67, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_089584ac9e9d", "text": "009). This is a critical mechanism for ensuring that experienced expatriate and national managers on the general track actively champion the development of high-potential nationals on the fast track. Beyond individual benefit, fostering a culture of mentorship has been shown to improve overall organizational performance through enhanced organizational learning and citizenship behaviors (T. D. Allen et al. 2009). As the OECD notes, a key function of a modern senior service system is to position managers as \u201cpeople developers\u201d and hold them accountable for cultivating the leadership pipeline (Gerson 2020). 3.5 Pacing and StaVing: Aligning with Supervisory Capacity Cohort size and promotion cadence must track available training and supervisory capacity. This capacity is not static; it is highly dependent on the active participation of experienced managers. A key challenge, particularly in the GCC context, is the risk of \u201cknowledge hiding\u201d by experienced expatriates who may fear being replaced by the national talent they are expected to train (Al Bastaki, Haak-Saheem, and Darwish 2021). Therefore, building sustainable supervisory capacity requires creating powerful incentives for mentorship. A crucial non-financial incentive is making the development of junior talent a key criterion for a manager\u2019s own career advancement, credibly signaling that mentoring is a valued leadership competency (Gentry, Weber, and Sadri 2008).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 68, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0a9a3245ca59", "text": "is making the development of junior talent a key criterion for a manager\u2019s own career advancement, credibly signaling that mentoring is a valued leadership competency (Gentry, Weber, and Sadri 2008). Where national targets are rising, a \u201cseasoned-hire floor\u201d in critical teams, a practice of blended staeing, stabilizes output while national cohorts mature. This model is economically sound, as research demonstrates that internally promoted employees perform significantly better for their first two years than external hires, who are often more expensive (Bidwell 2011). Maintaining a floor of experienced stae ensures operational continuity by leveraging their firm-specific skills while the fast-track cohort develops its own. However, this blended structure must be designed with care. If the seasoned-hire floor is significantly older than the national cohort, the resulting age hierarchy can inadvertently weaken the younger group\u2019s motivation to compete, undermining the system\u2019s \u201ctournament\u201d dynamic (Talavera, Yin, and Zhang 2021).

Company Case Studies: Local Practice and Transferable Patterns The dual-track talent system, which combines a fast-track for developing national talent with general recruitment for experienced professionals, is not merely a theoretical construct. Its application is evident across key sectors in Qatar. The following case studies illustrate established local practices and transferable patterns that demonstrate how firms navigate the tension between nationalization and productivity. 4.1 Banking and Financial Services: A GCC-Wide Pattern The banking and financial services sector across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a primary field for implementing nationalization policies, making it a rich source of case studies on the dual- track talent model.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 70, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_57bdea3f092f", "text": "ancial services sector across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a primary field for implementing nationalization policies, making it a rich source of case studies on the dual- track talent model.

The success of these dual-track systems in preserving productivity hinges on two key design principles observed across the region: 1. Work-Led, Rotational Development: Fast-track programs typically combine structured rotations through critical business functions (e.g., a revenue-generating post and a control/risk post) to build essential, on-the-job experience. 2. Rigorous, Merit-Based Progression: Advancement is gated by competency-based assessments, such as assessment-center exercises or defended capstone projects, rather than being based on tenure.

At QatarEnergy, Qatarization is an integral part of the strategic workforce plan. Initiatives include the National Graduate Development Programme (NGDP), which provides a competency-based framework and tailored Individual Development Plans (IDPs) to enable Qatari graduates to become fully qualified professionals (QatarEnergy LNG n.d.; QatarEnergy 2025). These programs formalize development through competency sign-oes, safety credentialing, and mentor- of-record logs. This structured approach is crucial, as studies on Qatar\u2019s oil and gas industry have shown that training eeectiveness is strongly linked to educational background and subsequent promotion opportunities, making a clear, merit-based pathway a key motivator (Jolo 2008).

The sector\u2019s approach is a carefully balanced model of blended staeing. While the \u201cfast tracks\u201d build a sustainable pipeline of national talent for leadership and key technical roles, experienced external specialists (often expatriates) remain in place to ensure operational continuity and transfer crucial tacit knowledge. This is particularly vital in safety-critical roles. Research in the petrochemical industry emphasizes that a positive safety culture, eeective communication, and strong leadership are paramount to performance and preventing incidents (N Naji et al. 2022). Therefore, promotions into such roles are strictly contingent on competency sign-oes and incident-free tenure, not merely program completion. This careful, competency-gated design ensures that as national cohorts mature, the organization\u2019s high standards for safety and productivity are maintained. The system\u2019s credibility is the engine that allows it to meet national policy goals without compromising operational excellence (Al-Horr 2011). 4.4 Public Financial Authorities: A Model of Blended StaVing Public financial entities across the GCC, such as central banks and regulatory authorities, explicitly illustrate the logic of a \u201cblended staeing\u201d model.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-22", "series_number": 10, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 79, "total_chunks": 125, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q10_EN_2025-09-22_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d11be73a8ff3", "text": "ncial Authorities: A Model of Blended StaVing Public financial entities across the GCC, such as central banks and regulatory authorities, explicitly illustrate the logic of a \u201cblended staeing\u201d model. These institutions operate in a context where national policy mandates the rapid development of local talent, yet the critical nature of their work, such as supervising markets, ensuring financial stability, and overseeing payments, demands deep, often internationally acquired expertise. This creates a clear imperative for a dual-track system where national graduate intakes build future capacity (\u201cthe fast track\u201d) while seasoned external hires ensure immediate operational continuity (\u201cthe general track\u201d). This approach is a direct response to strong nationalization policy imperatives. For instance, a circular from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) mandates the complete \u201cSaudization\u201d of all roles in money exchange firms within a one-year timeframe, requiring companies to submit a detailed plan for training and qualifying Saudi employees (SAMA 2018). Similarly, nationalization strategies like Qatarization are driven by quotas, such as the 20% target for the private and quasi-private sector in Qatar (Elbanna and Fatima 2022).

The design logic of operating dual pipelines under a single, rigorous quality standard maps directly onto the challenges faced by regulated private-sector contexts, providing a clear and transferable pattern for implementation. 5. Conclusion This report argues that dual-track systems can raise national inclusion without lowering productivity when, and only when, the fast track is truly competency-gated, transparent, and permeable. Internal Labor Markets provide the structure; tournament dynamics supply motivation; and organizational justice preserves legitimacy across the whole workforce.

Well-designed systems, by contrast, create a predictable leadership pipeline for nationals, stabilize delivery through blended staeing, and signal an authentic employer brand. For Qatar and the wider GCC, the operational blueprint is clear: codify merit-based milestones, validate readiness with capstone assessments, keep the fast track open to high performers from the general track, and align manager incentives with mentoring and coaching obligations. Done this way, firms can meet nationalization imperatives and build tomorrow\u2019s leaders without sacrificing today\u2019s performance. Key Takeaways: 1. Codify the rules of the game: Establish and publish clear eligibility criteria, assessment rubrics, and objective review panels. The pathway to the fast track must be transparent and contestable, remaining open to high-performing employees from the general track to ensure the system is perceived as fair and merit-based. 2. Harden milestones with competency-gated assessments: Progression must be earned, not based on tenure. Use capstone projects, portfolio defenses, and simulation- Page 29 of 47 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 22nd, 2025 based assessments to validate readiness before promotion.

Align manager incentives with development goals: Tie rewards, recognition, and promotion prospects for managers to the process of mentoring and coaching junior talent. This creates a powerful non-financial incentive for experienced expatriate and national managers on the general track to actively champion the development of high- potential nationals, turning mentorship into a core leadership responsibility. 4. Scale at the speed of capacity, not targets: The size of national cohorts and the pace of their promotion must be aligned with the organization\u2019s available training and supervisory capacity. Overloading the system to meet aggressive quotas without adequate support risks burnout, knowledge gaps, and a decline in productivity. 5. Maintain blended staNing as a core design feature: A \u201cseasoned-hire floor\u201d of experienced stae is essential to stabilize output, ensure operational continuity, and facilitate the transfer of crucial tacit knowledge while national cohorts mature.

Introduction 1.1 Strategic Vision and Definition of Qatarization Qatarization is a foundational policy of the State of Qatar aimed at enhancing the representation and participation of Qatari citizens across all economic sectors, with a sharpened focus on private sector integration. Its core objectives include reducing the nation\u2019s reliance on expatriate labor\u2014particularly in skilled and leadership roles\u2014and ensuring that Qataris play central roles in national development. As outlined in the Qatar National Vision 2030, the policy supports the Human Development pillar by enabling a capable and motivated national workforce (GSDP 2008). This vision is further operationalized through the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024\u20132030, which targets increasing the share of nationals in the private and semi-government sectors as part of a broader transition to a knowledge-based economy (PSA 2024). \"Meaningful and permanent employment\" in this context refers to roles that are not only financially rewarding but also aligned with individuals' skills and aspirations, ojering real advancement opportunities and contributing to national goals.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b6bdd1222cd2", "text": "s context refers to roles that are not only financially rewarding but also aligned with individuals' skills and aspirations, ojering real advancement opportunities and contributing to national goals.

Initiatives led by Qatar Foundation and the ojicial Qatarization platform Page 2 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 25th, 2025 also stress career development, training alignment, and structured employment pathways to ensure long-term workforce participation (QF n.d.; QatarEnergy n.d.). 1.2 Alignment with Qatar National Vision 2030 and NDS3 Qatarization is deeply embedded within the strategic priorities of the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024\u20132030. These national frameworks go beyond emphasizing citizen employment to outline a long-term transformation in the structure, capacity, and quality of Qatar\u2019s labor market. QNV 2030, particularly its Human Development pillar, envisions \u201ca capable and motivated workforce\u201d that supports economic diversification and contributes to sustained national prosperity (GSDP 2008).

NDS3 translates this vision into concrete labor market reforms by setting measurable goals and introducing phased interventions. Among its core targets is increasing the share of Qataris in the private and semi-governmental sectors from 17% (as of 2023) to 20% by 2030\u2014a net increase of approximately 16,000 Qatari employees (PSA 2024). The strategy places equal emphasis on both workforce quantity and quality, promoting career readiness through education reform, vocational training, and partnerships with employers to ensure Qataris are equipped for modern economic roles. This includes strong alignment between national employment policies and broader socioeconomic planning across sectors such as manufacturing, ICT, healthcare, and finance. Unlike earlier frameworks that concentrated on fulfilling numerical quotas, both NDS3 and QNV 2030 conceptualize Qatarization as an integrated, long-term development strategy. They reframe employment not merely as an end in itself, but as a mechanism for empowerment, socioeconomic inclusion, and institutional capacity-building (GSDP 2008; PSA 2024).

The focus has shifted from fulfilling quotas to building capabilities that strengthen institutional performance and national competitiveness, reflecting recent insights in human resource development research (Elbanna and Fatima 2022). 1.3 Historical Evolution of Qatarization Policy The prioritization of national employment in Qatar traces back to foundational legislative ejorts such as Labor Law No. 3 of 1962, which laid the groundwork for regulating labor relations in the post-independence era (\u201cThe Labour Law No. 3 of 1962\u201d n.d.). Early Qatarization initiatives in the 1970s focused predominantly on nationalizing roles within the public sector, particularly in administration, education, and public services \u2013 fields seen as critical for building state capacity after independence (U.S. Department of State n.d.). A major policy shift occurred in May 1997, when an Emiri decree mandated that private companies employ a minimum of 20% Qatari citizens, marking a pivotal expansion of Qatarization into the private sector (Cathleen et al. 2007). This was followed by a 2000 initiative targeting 50% nationalization in the energy sector by 2005 (QatarEnergy n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fe8ed0ba2126", "text": "pivotal expansion of Qatarization into the private sector (Cathleen et al. 2007).

Although the goal was ambitious and only partially met \u2013 reaching roughly 28% \u2013 it demonstrated strong political will and exposed structural and capacity challenges inherent in high-skill sector localization (Al- Yafei 2022). Over time, the conceptual underpinnings of Qatarization have shifted from numerical compliance toward \u201cquality Qatarization,\u201d a policy evolution informed by research highlighting Page 3 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 25th, 2025 the limitations of tokenism and emphasizing the importance of long-term skill development, retention, and empowerment (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). Quality Qatarization seeks to place nationals in roles that ojer not only employment but also opportunities for professional growth and meaningful contributions to organizational performance and national economic goals.

In reajirming its commitment, the Ministry of Labour has described job nationalization as a vital national priority and a key pillar of progress, underscoring its centrality to achieving long-term economic resilience and sustainable development (MoL 2024e).

Mechanisms for Integrating Nationals into Private Sector Employment Qatar deploys a multifaceted toolkit to stimulate the employment of its citizens in the private sector, combining regulatory mandates with a range of financial incentives and supportive programs aimed at both employers and Qatari job seekers.

These localization targets require private sector companies \u2013 particularly those above specific thresholds or operating in strategic sectors \u2013 to employ a minimum percentage of Qatari nationals. The application of quotas has been sector-sensitive, reflecting the varying degrees of strategic importance, workforce preparedness, and absorptive capacity across industries (Cathleen et al. 2007). \u2022 Energy Sector Leadership: The energy sector has consistently held one of the most ambitious targets, in part due to its centrality to national development and revenue generation. The 50% Qatarization target for permanent positions by 2005, though not fully achieved, served as a catalyst for deeper investment in local human capital pipelines (Al- Yafei 2022). Recent years have witnessed a reinvigoration of nationalization ejorts in this sector, with companies such as QatarEnergy, ExxonMobil, and NOC (North Oil Company) emphasizing in-house development programs, technical training, and leadership acceleration tracks for Qatari professionals (ExxonMobil in Qatar n.d.; North Oil Company (NOC) 2023; John 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9ff9f7cbb6e0", "text": "ompany) emphasizing in-house development programs, technical training, and leadership acceleration tracks for Qatari professionals (ExxonMobil in Qatar n.d.; North Oil Company (NOC) 2023; John 2024). \u2022 Finance and Banking Sector Initiatives: The finance and banking sector has also made progress, supported by development programs, university partnerships, and alignment with national strategies. Doha Bank and Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) introduced fast-track training in fintech and compliance with institutions like Carnegie Mellon Qatar (Doha Bank 2025; QIB 2024). Ahlibank also invests in upskilling and succession planning (AhliBank 2024). These ejorts align with the Qatar Central Bank\u2019s Financial Sector Strategy 2024\u20132030, which prioritizes workforce nationalization and resilience (QCB 2024). \u2022 Broader Sectoral Targets under NDS3: Outside the key sectors of energy and finance, a general 20% Qatarization quota has historically applied to private and semi-government entities. However, the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) introduces a more dijerentiated approach, identifying eight priority sectors for focused nationalization: manufacturing, logistics, tourism, IT, finance, education, agriculture, and healthcare (MoL 2024d; PSA 2024; GSDP 2008).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_757ce9f5caed", "text": "ated approach, identifying eight priority sectors for focused nationalization: manufacturing, logistics, tourism, IT, finance, education, agriculture, and healthcare (MoL 2024d; PSA 2024; GSDP 2008).

While recent reforms have narrowed some of the gaps, significant dijerences persist in salaries, allowances, and long-term security, all of which aject the perceived attractiveness of private sector jobs for nationals. Notably, Qatar\u2019s recent social insurance reforms introduced under Law No. 1 of 2022 have improved pension benefits for Qatari nationals working in the private sector. The guaranteed minimum pension of QAR 15,000 aims to reduce the disparity in retirement income between sectors (SSA 2022; Lockton 2022). The 2025 Executive Regulations of the law also introduced measures intended to increase administrative transparency and improve the ejiciency of benefit delivery (GRSIA 2025). Nonetheless, public sector employees continue to enjoy unmatched advantages, such as a 10% salary supplement, housing and transportation allowances, and more comprehensive health insurance coverage (Remoly n.d.). Another unresolved challenge is the inconsistent application of national retirement and pension coverage across sectors.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_817db18595c0", "text": "on allowances, and more comprehensive health insurance coverage (Remoly n.d.). Another unresolved challenge is the inconsistent application of national retirement and pension coverage across sectors. For instance, Qatari employees in the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) are currently excluded from mandatory pension contributions under the GRSIA system, creating an unequal retirement landscape (Baker McKenzie n.d.). The 2022 reforms also extended the minimum retirement age to 50 and the required service period to 25 years across both sectors. While these reforms aim for sustainability, they may also discourage early retirement and present long-term planning challenges for some employees (Deloitte 2024). Ultimately, although ejorts to equalize employment conditions have seen progress, full parity remains a work in progress. Further alignment of benefits and stronger enforcement of equitable employment practices are essential to making private sector jobs genuinely competitive and desirable for Qataris (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). 2.2.2 Direct Salary Support Programs The government\u2019s wage supplement schemes represent the cornerstone of its compensation incentive strategy. These initiatives aim to bridge salary gaps between the public and private sectors and promote the hiring of Qatari nationals \u2013 including Tier 2 nationals, such as children of Qatari women married to non-Qataris \u2013 into meaningful roles across the private sector (MoL 2024b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ca12e97ecfbd", "text": "sectors and promote the hiring of Qatari nationals \u2013 including Tier 2 nationals, such as children of Qatari women married to non-Qataris \u2013 into meaningful roles across the private sector (MoL 2024b).

Notably, Qatar has not yet broadly implemented tax incentives for employers hiring nationals, although fiscal levers such as tax exemptions or reduced corporate tax rates have been explored in other GCC countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE (PwC 2025a).

In particular, sectors historically perceived as unattractive \u2013 such as logistics, hospitality, and retail \u2013 are now witnessing more stable employment trends among both Qatari nationals and Tier 2 nationals. This change is largely attributed to the layered approach of combining legal obligations (e.g., quota enforcement), financial incentives, and inclusive workforce integration strategies (GCO 2024c; Deloitte 2024) The strategic inclusion of Tier 2 nationals \u2013 especially children of Qatari women married to non- Qataris \u2013 has emerged as a significant equity milestone under the National Development Strategy 2024\u20132030.

These developments are reinforced by complementary strategies, such as the Job Nationalization Plan (2025) and wage support mechanisms like the National Response Guarantee Program, which subsidize Qatari hires while encouraging knowledge transfer and organizational integration (MoL 2025a, UNDSDG n.d.). Together, these models represent a critical evolution \u2013 from static quotas and general subsidies to tailored, performance-driven frameworks that embed Qatarization goals into the operational fabric of forward-looking enterprises. 2.4 Workforce Upskilling and Training Ecosystem Integrating Qatari nationals into private-sector roles has relied heavily on structured training, upskilling, and strategic partnerships.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fb8557ae37e6", "text": "enterprises. 2.4 Workforce Upskilling and Training Ecosystem Integrating Qatari nationals into private-sector roles has relied heavily on structured training, upskilling, and strategic partnerships.

Sectoral Outcomes: Achievements and Ongoing Challenges While Qatar has made commendable progress in integrating nationals into the private sector, the outcomes of Qatarization ejorts remain uneven across industries. Sectoral disparities continue to reflect variations in job attractiveness, working conditions, wage structures, and the availability of training pipelines. This section highlights model sectors, persistent gaps, and the implications for future policy. 3.1 Model Sectors: Energy and Finance 3.1.1 Energy Sector: Institutional Commitment and Capacity The energy sector's strategic significance and robust state ownership give it a clear edge in advancing Qatarization. Entities like QatarEnergy have developed strong national employment pipelines through international scholarships, mentorship, and leadership programs (QatarEnergy LNG 2019, 2024). Although the sector did not meet the 50% Qatarization target set for 2005 \u2013 achieving approximately 28% \u2013 it continues to hold one of the highest national participation rates among all sectors, especially in exploration, refining, and project management roles (Cathleen et al. 2007; QatarEnergy 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 31, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6a84b1ccb5f3", "text": "% \u2013 it continues to hold one of the highest national participation rates among all sectors, especially in exploration, refining, and project management roles (Cathleen et al. 2007; QatarEnergy 2024). 3.1.2 Banking and Finance: Regulatory Leverage and Cultural Advantage The financial sector, guided by the Qatar Central Bank\u2019s Third Financial Sector Strategic Plan, has made notable strides in Qatarization by prioritizing structured governance and human capital development (QCB 2024). National participation is especially prominent in customer-facing and administrative roles, with some institutions reporting rates above 30% (PwC 2024). However, technical areas like risk management and treasury still sujer from talent shortages \u2013 challenges made more pressing by the sector\u2019s ongoing digital transformation and adoption of AI and fintech solutions (Malyshev 2025; Chaudhry 2025). This underscores the need for advanced training programs and targeted education pathways to build specialized local expertise. 3.2 Sectors Requiring Tailored Interventions 3.2.1 Construction Sector: Structuring Entry Points Qatar\u2019s construction sector, heavily reliant on expatriate labor for project-based work, faces challenges in attracting nationals.

Long hours, remote sites, and physically intensive work deter Page 13 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 25th, 2025 participation. Tackling concerns about career progression and site conditions will be crucial for long-term participation (Mohiuddin 2025; CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2024). Vocational education programs are a cornerstone in preparing Qataris for supervisory roles, especially with their focus on technical and leadership skills tailored to industry needs. For example, institutions like Qatar Technical School and CNA-Q ojer specialized training aligned with Qatar National Vision 2030 and anticipated labor law reforms (Oxford Business Group 2019; UDST n.d.). These programs not only support skill-building but also help meet updated Qatarization targets by establishing clear pathways into leadership roles. However, program adaptability remains key as construction demands grow more specialized (ITA 2024; Matsh 2024b). While institutions provide strong technical and managerial training, much of it is classroom- focused and lacks sujicient real-world application (QVDC n.d.). Adding supervised internships, similar to HBKU's reciprocal training model, could help bridge this gap (HBKU 2022). 3.2.2 Hospitality and Tourism: Incentivizing Participation National integration into hospitality remains low due to modest wages, irregular shifts, and persistent public perceptions about service roles (ValuStrat 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_4417cf9d98f6", "text": "d Tourism: Incentivizing Participation National integration into hospitality remains low due to modest wages, irregular shifts, and persistent public perceptions about service roles (ValuStrat 2024). Yet, with tourism identified as a key diversification sector, sustained ejorts are needed to raise awareness of career pathways in hotel operations, guest services, and event management. Creating specialized training academies and clear promotion tracks could address deterrents by ojering hospitality-specific skills and visible career growth opportunities. Wage concerns might also be mitigated through wage support or tax incentives, paired with tailored nationalization policies (Sophia 2014). Public perception remains a challenge, but awareness campaigns and industry partnerships are helping reshape narratives (Al-Mohannadi 2025). Institutions now ojer programs such as Tourism Management degrees and practical training in customer service, helping bridge the skills gap in the sector (educations.com n.d.; Icon Training Centre n.d.; Learnovate Qatar n.d.). 3.2.3 Retail, Services, and Manufacturing: Strengthening SME Capacity These sectors struggle with low national participation, mainly due to limited career advancement, modest pay, and the inability of small firms to manage complex compliance requirements.

Collaborative ejorts with the ILO between 2021 and 2024 further strengthened data systems (FRAGOMEN 2024b). Recent innovations include real-time digital dashboards that track Qatarization targets by sector, gender, and occupational level and support predictive modeling and policy simulations (MoL 2024a; Qatar Open Data Portal 2025a). These tools, integrated within the Labor Market Information System, allow for forecasting workforce needs, identifying skill gaps, and modeling responses to demographic or economic shifts (NPC n.d.; Chukwube 2024).

NDS3\u2019s phased roadmap \u2013 advancing from foundational skill-building (2024\u20132025), to structural reforms (2026\u20132027), and fostering cultural shifts (2028\u20132030) \u2013 ojers a comprehensive framework for systemic change (Poddar and Mishra 2024). Law No. 12 reinforces this vision by mandating job posting transparency, centralized candidate pools, and standardized nationalization plans (STA 2024). The integration of digital governance tools \u2013 like live dashboards and sector-specific reporting \u2013 translates policy into measurable outcomes (Al-Kuwari 2024). Notably, this digital infrastructure enables disaggregated monitoring (e.g., by gender or industry) and supports strategic recalibration based on real-time data (Qatar Open Data Portal 2025b).

Key innovations include the Labor Market Information System (LMIS) and predictive analytics tools, which enable policymakers to monitor real-time labor trends and anticipate future market shifts (MoL 2024a; ILO Project Ojice for the State of Qatar 2025; Yuan 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 43, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_71faf9c33fa3", "text": "and predictive analytics tools, which enable policymakers to monitor real-time labor trends and anticipate future market shifts (MoL 2024a; ILO Project Ojice for the State of Qatar 2025; Yuan 2025). \u2022 These systems allow for dynamic quota adjustment, wage subsidy calibration, and training rollouts based on sector-specific demands, moving beyond static planning models (ILO Project Ojice for the State of Qatar 2025). \u2022 AI-powered nationalization algorithms are being developed to further personalize and optimize workforce matching, representing a shift toward proactive policymaking (Microsoft News Center 2023). \u2022 Economic incentives such as tax exemptions and salary co-financing schemes are also increasingly tied to real-time compliance and performance data, reinforcing accountability (MoL 2025b). \u2022 Platforms like Ouqoul streamline the private-sector recruitment of national jobseekers by integrating skills data with employer needs \u2013 making the system both ejicient and inclusive (IOE 2024).

By embedding these structural elements, Qatar\u2019s nationalization ejorts can remain adaptive to economic transitions, demographic shifts, and emerging global trends. 5. Conclusion Qatar\u2019s evolving Qatarization agenda represents a national strategy of workforce transformation, grounded in economic diversification and social inclusion goals set by Qatar National Vision 2030. As demonstrated in Sections 1 through 4, the approach has matured from one focused on numeric quotas to a more structured, skills-oriented framework, underpinned by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) and Law No. 12 of 2024. These reforms emphasize not only hiring but also building pathways to career development, leadership roles, and lifelong learning for Qatari nationals. Rather than pursuing Qatarization in isolation, policymakers have aligned legal mandates, labor market intelligence, and institutional partnerships to cultivate a more adaptive, sector-specific, and incentive-driven model. Initiatives now span from national training platforms and predictive analytics to performance-based incentives and mentorship ecosystems. These coordinated ejorts reflect a growing emphasis on creating conditions that allow Qataris to thrive in strategic private-sector roles, particularly in high-impact industries like energy, finance, construction, hospitality, and emerging tech.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-26", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q1_EN_2025-05-26_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-26", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b3dae903188d", "text": "hasis on creating conditions that allow Qataris to thrive in strategic private-sector roles, particularly in high-impact industries like energy, finance, construction, hospitality, and emerging tech.

Introduction 1.1 Overview of Sectoral Di5erentiation Qatar's nationalization initiative, \"Qatarization,\" strategically varies targets by industry, reflecting national priorities and labor market realities. The energy sector, a critical component of Qatar\u2019s economy, has notably been a priority area due to its direct alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030, emphasizing local capacity building and significant foreign investment inflows (EB 2021). Banking has also garnered substantial policy focus, driven by its pivotal role in economic development and the strong regulatory oversight exercised by the Qatar Central Bank (EB 2021; IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2025). In contrast, sectors such as hospitality and tourism demonstrate slower Qatarization progress, primarily due to their reliance on expatriate labor for typically lower-wage and high-turnover positions, compounded by the limitations posed by Qatar's relatively small local workforce (Fasano-Filho and Goyal 2004). The broader labor market trends in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), exacerbated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, further highlight these industry- specific diIerences and reinforce the need for tailored nationalization strategies (Sherman 2022; Khadri 2018).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f0af27061c53", "text": "C), exacerbated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, further highlight these industry- specific diIerences and reinforce the need for tailored nationalization strategies (Sherman 2022; Khadri 2018). 1.2 Progress and Challenges by Sector Sectors such as banking and government services have successfully achieved significant Qatarization rates, supported by stable, well-compensated roles that match local educational backgrounds and societal expectations (MoL 2024c; Jameel 2025). Conversely, construction and retail sectors encounter substantial challenges, as their reliance on expatriate labor stems from less attractive employment conditions, including lower wages and physically demanding roles that are less appealing to nationals (MoL 2024b; Council of Ministers Secretariat General n.d.). Success in nationalization eIorts hinges greatly on the inherent nature of each sector. Banking, for instance, aligns eIectively with Qatari nationals\u2019 formal education backgrounds, transferable skills, and familiarity with the domestic market, thus facilitating increased local participation (Erumban and Al-Mejren 2024; Commercial Bank 2024a; QNB 2024b; Peyton 2016). In contrast, sectors like construction and retail struggle with localization due to the perceived drawbacks of lower wages and intensive manual labor (Al-Asfour, Rajasekar, and Charkasova 2022; NPC 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_12ed9eac9c38", "text": "ntrast, sectors like construction and retail struggle with localization due to the perceived drawbacks of lower wages and intensive manual labor (Al-Asfour, Rajasekar, and Charkasova 2022; NPC 2024). 1.3 Toward Inclusive Sectoral Strategies Strategically designed skill development initiatives, such as vocational training programs and sector-specific projects like the Rising Stars Program, can provide critical entry points and clear pathways for career advancement, making these less attractive sectors more appealing to locals Page 2 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 3rd, 2025 (MoL 2024c; MCIT 2024c; UDST n.d.; QatarEnergy n.d.b). Leadership-focused diversity initiatives, including specialized programs promoting the involvement of women in industries such as construction, can also foster inclusivity and broaden local workforce participation (Wilkerson 2024; HEC Paris, Doha 2021; WEF 2022). Moreover, cultural compatibility presents an additional barrier, especially in customer-facing sectors such as retail and hospitality. Developing targeted, culturally-sensitive training programs can help align roles within these sectors more closely with Qatari societal expectations, thereby enhancing their attractiveness to the local workforce (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023; Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_947b4fd71575", "text": "ithin these sectors more closely with Qatari societal expectations, thereby enhancing their attractiveness to the local workforce (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023; Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020). Ultimately, Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) provides a strategic framework for workforce nationalization tailored to sector-specific demands (GSDP 2008). For instance, the banking sector aligns naturally with QNV 2030's emphasis on fostering a digital economy and innovation- driven industries, oIering skill-intensive roles crucial to economic diversification (QRDI Council n.d.; ITA 2024c). Conversely, sectors like hospitality face unique challenges, including irregular working hours and cultural expectations, which can be systematically addressed through tailored educational and training programs designed to enhance workforce inclusivity (Kabbani 2025b; GCO n.d.; Mohiuddin 2025). 2. Qatarization and Labor Market Structure 2.1 Strategic Prioritization and Sectoral Divergence Qatarization, as a human development strategy, seeks to increase Qatari participation in the workforce, particularly within critical sectors such as energy, banking, and hospitality (Stasz et al. 2007; Arugay 2021). These sectors are strategically prioritized due to their centrality to Qatar\u2019s economic diversification goals and long-term sustainability. However, challenges to localization vary widely by sector, reflecting operational, economic, and institutional dynamics.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_714c9aef8046", "text": "rality to Qatar\u2019s economic diversification goals and long-term sustainability. However, challenges to localization vary widely by sector, reflecting operational, economic, and institutional dynamics. In the energy sector, the availability of higher-skilled Qatari nationals and substantial investment in training infrastructure have helped move toward formal Qatarization targets, such as the 50% localization goal originally envisioned in the early 2000s (Stasz et al. 2007). Yet progress remains constrained by the continued need for specialized foreign technical expertise (Al Thani 2024; MOCI 2025). In stark contrast, the hospitality sector faces persistent skills mismatches, limited job appeal, and few advancement opportunities for Qatari nationals (Al-Subaiey 2016; Gonzalez et al. 2008b; Alsuwaidi 2020; PwC 2022). As a result, national representation in hospitality remains low, with the sector relying heavily on expatriate workers. 2.2 Public-Private Disparities and Workforce Segmentation The broader labor market is dominated by expatriate labor, with Qatari nationals making up less than 6% of the workforce. Over 90% of Qatari citizens continue to prefer public sector employment due to superior compensation packages, job security, and work-life balance (Mohamed 2021; Alsayegh 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c7b4120529b1", "text": "6% of the workforce.

This labor segmentation creates persistent gaps in private- sector nationalization, particularly in industries like banking and hospitality, which find it diIicult to attract and retain local talent. Page 3 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 3rd, 2025 While the banking sector has managed some success through targeted Qatarization quotas, leadership training programs, and internship schemes for nationals, these initiatives are not equally eIective across all sectors. Regulatory support and sector-specific incentives have helped enhance Qatari participation in banking, but industries with less prestige or fewer career pathways \u2013 such as hospitality \u2013 continue to lag (Gonzalez et al. 2008b; Al-Subaiey 2016; Alsuwaidi 2020). 2.3 Skills Gap and Education System Alignment Addressing this imbalance requires systemic reforms. A key area is the education-to- employment pipeline, which suIers from misalignments between graduate skillsets and labor market demand. Studies indicate that many Qatari graduates are not equipped with the soft and technical skills needed in private-sector industries (Khodr 2011; Mohamed 2021; Said and Alhares 2021; Sellami et al. 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_658ee3b7eeed", "text": "ies indicate that many Qatari graduates are not equipped with the soft and technical skills needed in private-sector industries (Khodr 2011; Mohamed 2021; Said and Alhares 2021; Sellami et al. 2023). Moreover, policy scholars have emphasized that a more integrated approach is needed \u2013 one that incorporates labor market forecasting, improved data systems, and demand-driven curriculum development. Linking nationalization goals to dynamic labor market analysis and performance metrics would help better align expectations and outcomes (Anani, Rizk, and Aydemir 2024; MoL 2024a,d,e; ILO Project OIice for the State of Qatar 2025). The following section builds on this by examining the intrinsic characteristics of work across industries and how they influence nationalization progress \u2013 particularly through lenses such as working conditions, wage structures, and social perceptions. 3. Sectoral Performance of Qatarization Policies Qatarization outcomes diIer substantially between the public and private sectors due to structural, cultural, and policy-based factors. This section examines how each domain has progressed in terms of local workforce integration, highlighting institutional dynamics, hiring patterns, and underlying challenges.

The analysis begins with the public sector \u2013 where Qataris dominate employment \u2013 and then shifts focus to the more complex landscape of private-sector localization. 3.1 Public Sector (Government and Civil Service) 3.1.1 Employment Concentration and Drivers Sectoral Qatarization outcomes in the public sector reveal significant progress but also highlight inherent structural limitations. The public sector \u2013 including ministries, education, healthcare, and state enterprises \u2013 remains the dominant employer of Qatari nationals, accounting for over 90% of citizen employment. This concentration is primarily driven by attractive benefits such as job security, favorable working conditions, and generous compensation packages (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024; NPC 2024; Bertelsmann Stiftung 2024). 3.1.2 Utilization and Skill Alignment While Qataris fill nearly all top administrative and clerical posts in ministries and educational institutions, this distribution has led to underutilization of human capital in some areas. Many positions held by nationals do not fully leverage their qualifications or allow for progressive skill Page 4 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 3rd, 2025 development (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_228f9587aa6f", "text": "leverage their qualifications or allow for progressive skill Page 4 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 3rd, 2025 development (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024). Social preferences reinforce this imbalance \u2013 government roles are seen as culturally aligned, less stressful, and more prestigious, which deters interest in private-sector alternatives (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). In 2023, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, Ministry of Endowments (Awqaf) and Islamic AIairs and the Ministry of Municipality, were among the largest recruiters of nationals, with 4,979 Qataris hired into government roles (The Peninsula 2024a). Of these, approximately 3,100 (68%) were women, underscoring the role of education and civil service as key employment channels for Qatari women (Qatar Tribune 2024). 3.1.3 Remaining Gaps and Policy Reform Despite this progress, several areas of the public sector \u2013 particularly in engineering, IT, and specialized policy units \u2013 still rely on expatriate expertise. Initiatives like the Government Scholarship Program have improved the pipeline of technical talent, but the number of qualified Qataris remains insuIicient to fully localize these segments. Policymakers have responded through institutional frameworks such as Qatar\u2019s National Development Strategy (NDS), which emphasizes public administration reform, performance- based recruitment, and human capital investment (PSA 2018; PSA 2024; MECGA 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c1bbd6476d28", "text": "orks such as Qatar\u2019s National Development Strategy (NDS), which emphasizes public administration reform, performance- based recruitment, and human capital investment (PSA 2018; PSA 2024; MECGA 2023).

The relatively small size of Qatar\u2019s national workforce limits the pace of localization, especially in specialized fields. Moreover, deeply rooted societal preferences for government work \u2013 especially among new graduates \u2013 continue to restrict broader labor mobility. As such, while the public sector has achieved notable Qatarization outcomes, future progress depends on rebalancing employment preferences, addressing skills mismatches, and linking education more directly with national development needs. The next subsection explores how the private sector has navigated these dynamics, with far more varied results. 3.2 Private Sector (Commercial and Industrial) Qatarization outcomes in the private sector remain varied and uneven, with each subsector facing distinct structural and operational challenges.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_998d95c3ea9d", "text": "esults. 3.2 Private Sector (Commercial and Industrial) Qatarization outcomes in the private sector remain varied and uneven, with each subsector facing distinct structural and operational challenges. In 2023, only 2,203 Qataris entered private- sector employment \u2013 less than half the number in government \u2013 despite incentives and regulatory reforms aimed at increasing national participation (The Peninsula 2024a; Qatar Tribune 2024). The following subsections examine key industries and their respective progress. 3.2.1 Energy and Public Infrastructure Services The oil, gas, and utilities sector in Qatar remains a cornerstone of the economy and has been a focal point for Qatarization eIorts, aligned with the Qatar National Vision 2030 (EIA 2023; QatarEnergy LNG 2024; QNA 2025a). The Qatarization program targets 50% Qatari representation in key roles and 100% in non-specialist positions (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). Large entities like QatarEnergy show relatively high nationalization rates, particularly in managerial and technical positions, supported by initiatives such as the NOC National Development Programme Page 5 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 3rd, 2025 to integrate Qatari talent (QNB 2024a; NOC n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 13, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_35cfb8e6f887", "text": "upported by initiatives such as the NOC National Development Programme Page 5 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 3rd, 2025 to integrate Qatari talent (QNB 2024a; NOC n.d.).

Qatar\u2019s reliance on expatriates, whose numbers surged from 280,000 in 1997 to over 2 million by 2017, highlights structural barriers to fully achieving nationalization in these areas (Kabbani 2025b). QatarEnergy has been addressing these skill gaps through tailored initiatives like the NOC National Development Programme, which specifically targets recently graduated Qataris (QatarEnergy LNG 2021; NOC n.d.). These programs provide structured training to build competencies for specialized roles, complemented by vocational and technician certificate programs that align with the nation's strategic goals. Additionally, the annual CEO Forum and fire training certifications emphasize leadership and technical expertise, directly supporting Qatar\u2019s broader energy sector needs (QatarEnergy LNG n.d., QatarEnergy n.d.b).

The Qatarization Program, launched in 2000, aimed for 50% Qatari workforce participation in the energy sector by 2005 but achieved only about 28% (Jameel 2025, Gonzalez et al. 2008a). This gap also may reflect the specialized skill demands of the energy industry, where roles require extensive technical expertise, unlike more accessible sectors like hospitality. To address this, the sector has ramped up investments in training, scholarships, and partnerships with educational institutions to build local capacity (QatarEnergy n.d.a, 2024; QFZ 2024). While Qatari representation is gradually increasing, systematic reporting on recent progress remains limited, highlighting ongoing challenges in meeting localization goals (Jameel 2025). Qatar's Qatarization Law No.12 of 2024, eIective April 2025, exempts companies directly involved in petroleum exploration, production, petrochemicals, and those linked to QatarEnergy (ES 2024; Middle East Briefing 2024).

Nationalization strategies have been particularly visible in major banks like Commercial Bank and Doha Bank, which have launched leadership development programs, internships, and fast-track career schemes tailored for Qataris (Commercial Bank 2024b,2025a,b; Doha Bank 2013). Despite these eIorts, Qatar\u2019s labor market remains structurally dominated by expatriate labor. According to oIicial 2023 data, non-Qataris constitute over 94% of the total economically active population, a demographic reality that poses fundamental structural challenges to further localization (NPC 2025a).

Qatar\u2019s financial sector has shown tangible progress in Qatarisation, particularly in business administration, retail banking, and insurance services. In Q3 2023, the number of Qataris employed in the private sector rose by 150 % year-on-year, with finance and insurance roles accounting for much of that increase (The Peninsula 2023; Qatar Tribune 2024). Although this surge predates the promulgation of Law No. 12 of 2024, it is broadly consistent with the policy momentum that culminated in the law, which now sets explicit nationalization targets across private-sector domains, including financial services (Qawl Fassel 2024; MoL 2024b).

Nonetheless, Qatarization policies increasingly encourage the hiring of nationals in administrative and academic roles through soft incentives and strategic subsidies (Al-Subaiey 2016; MoL 2024d). Healthcare mirrors this pattern. While the public sector remains the primary employer through entities like Hamad Medical Corporation, private healthcare providers have expanded rapidly in recent years (Raf Healthcare Consultancy 2025). Government statements describe Qatar\u2019s healthcare system as \u201cworld-class\u201d following major infrastructure and service upgrades, and the 2024 \u201cHealth for All\u201d strategy aims to deepen private-sector collaboration and skill localization (QNA 2024b; KUNA 2025). Although explicit Qatarization quotas in private hospitals remain limited, recent initiatives \u2013 including national scholarship schemes and clinical residency tracks \u2013 are designed to build local capacity in technical and specialist roles \u2013 a trend supported by academic analyses of Qatar\u2019s health-care labour market (Goodman 2015).

In contrast, sectors like hospitality struggle not only due to skill gaps but also cultural preferences that discourage Qatari engagement in lower-wage service roles (Amin and Cochrane 2023, Alsuwaidi 2020).

Several factors underlie this imbalance. Cultural preferences among Qataris favor administrative or oIice-based employment in sectors perceived as more prestigious, such as government, banking, or education.

For instance, hospitality and retail roles \u2013 especially in front-line services \u2013 are often perceived by Qataris as low-prestige or non-strategic, resulting in low national participation despite Qatar\u2019s continued investment in luxury retail expansion (NPC 2024; Abdallah, Dashper, and Fletcher 2023; Quest Search and Selection 2024). This perception persists even though service excellence aligns with Qatar\u2019s cultural values of hospitality (Alsuwaidi 2020). The labor market data supports this trend: as of 2023, Qatar maintained a national unemployment rate below 0.5%, reducing the incentive for locals to pursue low-wage or physically demanding jobs (Kabbani 2025b). Consequently, these industries remain heavily dependent on expatriate labor. The gendered dimension also matters \u2013 Qatari women, in particular, face added societal expectations that discourage participation in hospitality roles (Abdallah, Dashper, and Fletcher 2023). In contrast, the ICT sector shows more potential for Qatarization.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8ccb17af7e4c", "text": "ticular, face added societal expectations that discourage participation in hospitality roles (Abdallah, Dashper, and Fletcher 2023).

Higher salaries, perceived career prestige, and alignment with the country\u2019s digital transformation agenda make this field increasingly attractive to nationals (MCIT 2024a,b; Strategy Hub 2025; QFZ n.d.). However, skill mismatches persist. The pace of technological change has outstripped the supply of suitably trained local professionals, making workforce development in this area a priority. EIorts to bridge these gaps include vocational training programs, career awareness campaigns, and partnerships between employers and schools. Initiatives like Career Village 2025, organized by the Qatar Career Development Center, aim to familiarize young nationals with emerging private-sector opportunities and counter cultural stigmas (QNA 2025b). Looking ahead, meaningful progress in these sectors will depend on a dual strategy: enhancing sector-specific skill development and reframing the social narrative around service jobs. Success stories of Qataris excelling in non-traditional roles could help shift public perception. At the same time, stronger regulatory and institutional support will be critical to scale up national participation across these underrepresented areas (MoL 2024d; Al Thani 2024).

This section synthesizes structural, cultural, and institutional constraints common to multiple industries. 4.1 Skills and Education Gaps Qatar\u2019s labor market continues to experience significant gaps between educational outputs and industry demands. While many nationals pursue degrees in arts, business, and social sciences \u2013 fields well-represented at institutions like Qatar University and international branches such as Georgetown and Carnegie Mellon \u2013 there remains an acute shortage of technical and vocational graduates in critical sectors like engineering, manufacturing, and advanced ICT (Zaidan et al. 2025). Recent analyses underscore the uneven implementation of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in Qatar. A study of postsecondary TVET institutions highlights challenges such as limited program capacity and curriculum misalignment with labor market needs, resulting in underprepared graduates and persistent skill mismatches (Said, Pavlova, and Wheeler 2021; Ahmad et al. 2023). Moreover, research published in Heliyon (2023) examines the evolving skill requirements of Qatar\u2019s rapidly diversifying economy \u2013 particularly in sectors such as construction and logistics \u2013 and calls for agile curriculum development and stronger industry\u2013academy partnerships to close these gaps (Sellami et al. 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 29, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f7832e466748", "text": "economy \u2013 particularly in sectors such as construction and logistics \u2013 and calls for agile curriculum development and stronger industry\u2013academy partnerships to close these gaps (Sellami et al. 2023). Similarly, transport and mobility studies emphasize the need for specialized technical diplomas and continuous professional development to meet advanced infrastructure and smart-city objectives (Amin and Cochrane 2023). Although scholarship programs and new technical institutes have been established, the pace of reform remains insuIicient. To better align nationalization eIorts with workforce needs, Qatar must invest in scalable TVET infrastructure, recruit qualified trainers, and ensure hands-on access to modern equipment \u2013 key steps for enabling Qatari graduates to enter and thrive in complex, technical industries. 4.2 Cultural and Preference Barriers Qatari employment choices are shaped by deep-rooted cultural norms, family responsibilities, and institutional incentives that favor stable, high-status roles in the public sector.

In contrast, labor-intensive and high-growth private industries \u2013 construction, logistics, manufacturing, and hospitality \u2013 remain reliant on expatriate labor. Expatriates constitute more than 94% of construction jobs and continue to dominate other manual sectors, reflecting both a skills gap and societal perceptions that these roles lack prestige (Kabbani 2025b; The Peninsula 2020). Economic and social disparities further influence these patterns: regional and sectoral inequalities highlighted by QatarCPD reveal that private-sector wages and career progression opportunities do not yet match public-sector benchmarks, limiting national participation (Mohseni 2025). While diversification strategies under NDS3 encourage national engagement in tourism, ICT, and entrepreneurship, implementation is uneven. Enhanced career guidance, labor market awareness campaigns, and family-friendly workplace policies are necessary to shift perceptions and broaden the appeal of nontraditional employment paths for future Qatari graduates. 4.3 Private Sector Dynamics and Incentives Qatar\u2019s expanding private sector \u2013 driven by diversification into finance, construction, ICT, and hospitality \u2013 has frequently outpaced the national labor supply.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 31, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b1dc4bc2ae99", "text": "ivate Sector Dynamics and Incentives Qatar\u2019s expanding private sector \u2013 driven by diversification into finance, construction, ICT, and hospitality \u2013 has frequently outpaced the national labor supply. This is largely due to the demographic reality that Qatari nationals constitute a small fraction of the population relative to the overall workforce demand. In 2023, Qataris accounted for less than 20% of all workers in the private sector, despite targeted nationalization policies (NPC 2025c). Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are central to private sector growth, face additional constraints. Many lack the financial bandwidth or institutional frameworks to establish robust training pipelines or to compete with larger firms for qualified national talent (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024; Al-Qahtani et al. 2022). Meanwhile, public sector roles remain significantly more attractive to Qataris, contributing to a limited supply of nationals available for private sector roles (NPC 2025c). As a result, many private firms \u2013 especially in sectors like banking, ICT, and hospitality \u2013 continue to rely heavily on expatriate workers who possess the technical expertise, international exposure, and adaptability that align with business needs (StaIhouse 2025; Fragomen 2024).

While Qatar\u2019s Labor Law No. 14 of 2004 ensures equal pay for equal work and opportunities for training and promotion, persistent societal attitudes and workplace structures continue to create gendered barriers (Hazratji 2021). The majority of employed Qatari women are concentrated in education, healthcare, and public administration \u2013 sectors aligned with both educational backgrounds and societal expectations. However, more recent trends suggest growing participation in fields like finance, IT, and business services, especially among younger cohorts (MyPrivateTutor Qatar n.d.; Alsuwaidi 2020). This shift reflects not only evolving norms but also the increasing emphasis on \u201cquality Qatarization,\u201d which prioritizes meaningful and skilled employment over numerical targets.

Large-scale infrastructure initiatives, particularly those associated with the FIFA World Cup and Qatar National Vision 2030, have substantially increased short-term labor demand \u2013 especially in construction, logistics, and service-related sectors that typically see low participation from nationals (NPC 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-03", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 36, "total_chunks": 69, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q2_EN_2025-06-03_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-03", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8d23a8f7be3d", "text": "Vision 2030, have substantially increased short-term labor demand \u2013 especially in construction, logistics, and service-related sectors that typically see low participation from nationals (NPC 2024). As a result, the demographic reality presents a long-standing constraint on expanding Qatarization at scale. Furthermore, the labor force participation rate for Qatari nationals stood at approximately 54% in 2023, revealing a relatively limited pool of economically active citizens compared to expatriate cohorts, which often exhibit participation rates exceeding 90% in prime working age brackets (Qatar Open Data Portal n.d.). These demographic and participation dynamics are compounded by structural factors such as educational mismatches, prevailing preferences for public sector employment, and limited attraction to low-prestige or physically demanding sectors (Sayre, Benmansour, and Constant 2015; Al-Subaiey 2016; Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). Experts increasingly argue that addressing these challenges requires a shift away from quota- focused approaches toward systemic reform (Elbanna and Fatima 2022).

This includes aligning educational programs with labor market demands, enhancing vocational readiness, and improving incentives for both job seekers and employers. A strategic HRM perspective emphasizes the importance of long-term investments in skills development, institutional capacity, and policy coherence, rather than over-reliance on numerical targets alone (Elbanna et al. 2021; Kabbani 2025a). 5. Conclusion Qatar\u2019s Qatarization strategy has evolved significantly, shifting from numerical employment targets to a more strategic focus on sector-specific skill development, systemic educational reforms, and institutional adaptability. This report emphasizes that success in workforce nationalization varies significantly across sectors, influenced by factors such as the alignment of educational outputs with industry demands, cultural attitudes toward employment, gender dynamics, and demographic constraints. EIorts in sectors like finance and energy highlight successful pathways to localization through targeted training, leadership development programs, and clear regulatory frameworks.

Moreover, the importance of gender-inclusive policies and frameworks is underscored by the lower female labor participation rates among nationals. Future Qatarization eIorts should prioritize enhancing educational alignment with labor market needs, particularly in vocational and technical education, while simultaneously addressing cultural barriers through awareness initiatives and structured incentives. Additionally, the continued development of predictive analytics and robust monitoring systems will be essential to eIectively anticipate labor market trends and adapt policies proactively. Stakeholder collaboration between government entities, private sector organizations, and educational institutions remains crucial to sustainable and inclusive workforce nationalization. Key Takeaways: 1. Sector-specific Tailoring: Qatarization eIectiveness requires nuanced, sector-specific approaches addressing unique workforce challenges and opportunities. 2.

Introduction 1.1 Workforce Nationalization and Qatarization Workforce nationalization refers to government-led strategies aimed at increasing the employment of local citizens in both public and private sectors, thereby reducing reliance on expatriate labor. These policies have been deployed under various banners across the Gulf\u2014 such as Emiratization (UAE), Saudization (Saudi Arabia), and Omanization (Oman)\u2014each influenced by local labor dynamics, political imperatives, and demographic pressures. Saudi Arabia began nationalization eVorts as early as the 1980s, with the launch of the Nitaqat system in 2011 marking a notable institutional milestone (Basahal, Forde, and MacKenzie 2023). This system categorized firms based on their compliance with national hiring targets. However, the policy\u2019s impact was constrained by the persistent appeal of public-sector jobs and the absence of eVective labor market matching mechanisms, factors explored in the context of Saudi Arabia\u2019s quota-based system (Durand-Lasserve 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fe8558a1a405", "text": "the persistent appeal of public-sector jobs and the absence of eVective labor market matching mechanisms, factors explored in the context of Saudi Arabia\u2019s quota-based system (Durand-Lasserve 2022).

More recently, Saudi Arabia has expanded Saudization mandates to additional professions, requiring compliance across engineering, finance, and IT sectors, with full enforcement expected by 2025 (Middle East Briefing 2025). Omanization, similarly, was formalized in the 1980s and has emphasized localizing roles in sectors like construction, retail, and banking. While the program has improved national visibility in the labor force, long-standing structural issues such as segmentation between expatriate- dominated and nationalized sectors, wage disparities, and inconsistent enforcement continue to limit its broader success. These dynamics have been observed in both historical and contemporary evaluations of Oman\u2019s labor market reforms (Das and Gokhale 2010; Yoel 2018).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_62fae01880fb", "text": "enforcement continue to limit its broader success.

Across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), nationalization has been pursued not only as an employment strategy but also as a social contract mechanism\u2014aimed at rebalancing citizenship entitlements within rentier-state economies. However, its execution has produced uneven results. Research highlights that structural impediments\u2014including deep-rooted segmentation between public and private labor markets, overdependence on expatriate workers, and underinvestment in skills development\u2014remain central obstacles (ILO 2023; Winckler 2024). Additionally, new scholarship points to the growing emergence of 'labor market outsiders' among nationals themselves\u2014those excluded from both stable public-sector roles and competitive private opportunities\u2014resulting in frustration and disillusionment with nationalization goals (Elbanna and Fatima 2022; Hertog 2025). This is compounded by limited enforcement capacity and weak alignment between education systems and market demands. Elbanna\u2019s research on workforce nationalization across GCC countries identifies persistent institutional inertia, insuVicient stakeholder coordination, and a lack of long-term strategic planning as key inhibitors to policy success (Elbanna 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_022b0343f3d8", "text": "across GCC countries identifies persistent institutional inertia, insuVicient stakeholder coordination, and a lack of long-term strategic planning as key inhibitors to policy success (Elbanna 2022). 1.2 Qatarization: Policy Evolution and Strategic Role Qatarization is the national employment strategy adopted by the State of Qatar to ensure meaningful participation of Qatari nationals in the workforce, particularly in strategic sectors such as energy, finance, and government. While the term 'Qatarization' became widely used following Emiri directives in 1997\u2014which required private companies to employ Qataris in at least 20 percent of their jobs\u2014the origins of the policy can be traced back to 1962, when Law No. 3 was enacted to grant priority employment rights to Qataris across various sectors (State of Qatar 1962). By the time of independence in 1971, all administrative posts in the public sector were already held by Qatari nationals (Stasz et al. 2007a; Wiedmann, Salama, and Thierstein 2012). The 1997 directive marked a turning point in extending this policy emphasis to the private sector, setting employment targets such as a quota-based system that set national employment targets of 50 percent in the energy sector and 20 percent in private and semi-governmental entities by 2005 (Stasz et al. 2007a; Doha News Team 2013). Despite initial state backing, Qatarization targets have remained largely unmet.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_647b84c54404", "text": "rgy sector and 20 percent in private and semi-governmental entities by 2005 (Stasz et al. 2007a; Doha News Team 2013). Despite initial state backing, Qatarization targets have remained largely unmet. Studies have attributed this outcome to structural segmentation between national and expatriate labor forces, institutional weaknesses, and insuVicient alignment between higher education and the needs of key industries (Stasz et al. 2007b; Hertog 2014). Labor force data from 2004 shows that only 1.5 percent of Qataris were employed in what was then defined as the private sector (limited to banking, insurance, and hospitality). Labor force data from 2004 shows that only 1.5 percent of Qataris worked in what was then defined as the private sector. When including mixed-sector entities, this rises to about 8.7 percent. Meanwhile, 68 percent were employed in government and Page 3 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 23 percent in fully state-owned corporations. These figures reflect the dominance of public employment and the limited impact of quotas in encouraging private-sector participation (QSA 2005). These shortfalls were compounded by limited institutional coordination and lack of preparedness among private employers to absorb national talent (Constant, Sayre, and Abdelkader 2015).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2f3a901a2308", "text": "n (QSA 2005).

The initial emphasis of Qatarization was sectoral\u2014focused heavily on the oil and gas industry, which continues to be one of the most active areas for national employment targets. Companies such as Qatar Petroleum (now QatarEnergy) were mandated to achieve specific Qatarization quotas, often around 50% in technical and administrative roles (QatarEnergy n.d.). However, implementation challenges soon emerged, including the limited pool of technically skilled nationals, high wage expectations, and preferences for public-sector roles (Gonzalez et al. 2008). In response, new policy instruments were introduced, such as scholarship programs, leadership development tracks, and partnerships between universities and state-owned enterprises to cultivate future talent pipelines (QatarEnergy LNG n.d.; Gasal n.d.).

In alignment with the objectives set forth in the Qatar National Vision 2030 and further articulated in the National Development Strategies (NDS1\u2013NDS3), stakeholders including the Ministry of Labor, the Qatar Financial Centre, and national universities have implemented internship schemes, wage subsidy programs, and employment platforms aimed at supporting the integration of nationals into priority economic sectors (GSDP 2008,2011; PSA 2018,2024). A 2024 initiative by the Ministry of Labor focused on expanding job-matching services and engaging private employers to advance localization in both established and emerging industries. However, the same initiative reported that employers continue to express concerns over skills mismatches, absenteeism, and high turnover, pointing to an ongoing disconnect between educational outcomes and job market needs (MoL 2024b). While new platforms and training interventions have emerged, such as the updated national employment portal announced in 2024 (MoL 2024c), broader reforms in vocational education, sector-specific planning, and employer incentives are still required to ensure meaningful outcomes.

Despite these barriers, Qatarization remains a core pillar of the human development strategy. In contrast to earlier localization programs in neighboring countries, Qatar\u2019s model is closely tied to its long-term economic transformation agenda. Workforce nationalization is framed not only as a labor market necessity but also as a contributor to innovation, productivity, and sustainable development. However, balancing the imperatives of localization with the demands of a competitive and technologically evolving economy continues to require more agile and evidence-based policy instruments. 1.3 Defining Skill Mismatch 1.3.1 International Definitions and Implications Skill mismatch refers to the discrepancy between the skills that workers possess and those that are required by employers for specific jobs. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), it encompasses overqualification (where workers have more skills than needed), underqualification (where they lack necessary competencies), and skill obsolescence (where existing skills become outdated due to technological or structural changes in the economy) (ILO 2017, 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_035cbbc8fbde", "text": "underqualification (where they lack necessary competencies), and skill obsolescence (where existing skills become outdated due to technological or structural changes in the economy) (ILO 2017, 2020). Internationally, skill mismatch is widely acknowledged as a critical ineViciency in labor markets, especially in economies undergoing structural changes. Cedefop emphasizes that mismatches hamper economic growth, prolong unemployment, and suppress productivity and wages Page 5 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 (Cedefop 2015). The ILO concurs, stressing that underutilization of workers\u2019 skills diminishes labor potential and underscores the need for responsive education systems and better labor market data to anticipate demand trends (ILO 2024). The European Commission similarly warns that unresolved mismatches weaken labor reallocation processes and intensify long-term unemployment unless paired with robust educational reforms (Vandeplas and Thum-Thysen 2019). Shin and Bills (2021) further highlight that skill mismatches not only disrupt individual employment outcomes but also compromise overall economic performance through ineVicient use of human capital and reduced innovation (Shin and Bills 2021). 1.3.2 International Definitions and Implications In the GCC, where nationalization strategies often emphasize numerical targets over skills alignment, skills mismatches are frequently exacerbated by fragmented labor systems.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 13, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_50f12c5944bb", "text": "itions and Implications In the GCC, where nationalization strategies often emphasize numerical targets over skills alignment, skills mismatches are frequently exacerbated by fragmented labor systems. A report by PwC notes that across the region, employers face persistent challenges in recruiting nationals with the right technical and soft skills for evolving roles in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing (PwC 2024). Ashmawi (2015) discusses how poorly aligned education-to-employment pipelines in Arab countries, including Qatar, have led to significant underemployment among qualified nationals, with many being hired into roles unrelated to their training or aspirations (Ashmawi 2015). These challenges are compounded by prestige-driven preferences for public-sector roles and limited private-sector training opportunities (Elbanna et al. 2023). 1.3.3 Qatar-Specific Evidence and Policy Gaps Within the context of Qatarization, skill mismatch frequently arises when nationals are appointed to roles for which they lack the requisite training or interest\u2014often to fulfill localization quotas rather than support long-term workforce strategy. Research conducted on Qatar\u2019s vocational and higher education systems highlights persistent challenges in aligning graduate output with labor market needs, particularly in STEM and manufacturing sectors (Said and Alhares 2021; PwC 2022). A recent empirical study by Elsharnouby et al.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 14, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6675927d2c99", "text": "istent challenges in aligning graduate output with labor market needs, particularly in STEM and manufacturing sectors (Said and Alhares 2021; PwC 2022).

These challenges are reflected in persistent disconnects between academic curricula and the competencies prioritized by private-sector employers, particularly in Qatar\u2019s key sectors. Although the National Development Strategy 2024\u20122030 (NDS3) emphasizes enhancing employability and education-to-employment alignment, it does not explicitly reference \u201cskill mismatch\u201d as a concept. Instead, it prioritizes broader goals such as improving labor market eViciency and strengthening workforce competencies through reforms like vocational training and private-sector collaboration (PSA 2024). Nonetheless, challenges remain in translating these goals into measurable progress due to persistent gaps in institutional coordination and stakeholder alignment.

The analysis addresses the following questions: 1. Intent vs. Outcome: What are the stated goals of Qatarization, and how do actual labor market dynamics align\u2014or misalign\u2014with these objectives? 2. Mechanisms: How do quota systems and government policies influence hiring decisions, and do they consider skills and competencies adequately? 3. Impacts: What evidence exists of productivity loss, job dissatisfaction, and turnover due to mismatched placements? 4. Solutions: What policy reforms, training strategies, or institutional changes might better align Qatarization eVorts with real labor market needs? The findings are based on academic literature, oVicial statistics, employer feedback, and policy evaluations.

If so, these challenges demand policy refinement to enhance both eVectiveness and equity in workforce integration. 2. A Typology of Skill Mismatch under Qatarization 2.1 OverstaIing and Underutilization in Government and Quota-Filled Roles One of the most persistent and visible manifestations of skill mismatch under Qatarization arises in the form of overstaVing and role underutilization\u2014particularly within government institutions and quota-driven private entities. Qatarization mandates often lead to staVing decisions that emphasize numerical compliance over actual institutional need, resulting in the ineVicient deployment of national talent (Bunglawala 2011). The IMF (2024) identifies bloated staVing structures in Qatar\u2019s public institutions, where excessive national hiring has led to narrowly defined, largely administrative roles that hinder operational eViciency (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0cc561377a8f", "text": "atar\u2019s public institutions, where excessive national hiring has led to narrowly defined, largely administrative roles that hinder operational eViciency (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024). Fatima and Elbanna (2022) add that such overstaVing diminishes role clarity and fosters a mismatch between task requirements and employee competencies (Elbanna and Fatima 2022). Elsharnouby et al. (2023) reinforce this institutional critique by highlighting that local job seekers and employees often view Qatarization placements as lacking in substance, primarily due to the limited opportunities for professional development and meaningful engagement in their roles. Perceptions of limited development opportunities and inadequate role engagement contribute to diminished morale and dissatisfaction among local employees, reinforcing feelings of disengagement and questioning the substantive value of Qatarization placements (Elsharnouby Page 7 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 et al. 2023). Collectively, these findings point to structural ineViciencies that suppress both individual growth and institutional productivity. Such misalignment not only curbs institutional productivity but also erodes morale, as employees find themselves in roles that neither challenge their skills nor contribute meaningfully to organizational objectives.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 18, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c3a95f07a99d", "text": "t not only curbs institutional productivity but also erodes morale, as employees find themselves in roles that neither challenge their skills nor contribute meaningfully to organizational objectives. 2.2 Forced Promotions and Role Misalignment In parallel with overstaVing, accelerated or premature promotions represent another dimension of mismatch that continues to undermine the goals of Qatarization. In institutions eager to meet localization targets, some nationals are advanced to supervisory or managerial roles before acquiring the necessary technical experience or leadership training. While these promotions satisfy compliance indicators, they often result in role misalignment, diminished performance, and lower self-confidence among the promoted individuals (Elbanna and Fatima 2022; Fatima and Elbanna 2025). This phenomenon is not new. A RAND study highlighted as early as 2008 that the rapid advancement of Qatari nationals\u2014especially within government ministries and public sector companies\u2014frequently resulted in job-role mismatches, with many promotions deemed nominal, aimed more at meeting quota expectations than building institutional leadership capacity (Gonzalez et al. 2008). These patterns persist.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_7698f0fd68fe", "text": "d in job-role mismatches, with many promotions deemed nominal, aimed more at meeting quota expectations than building institutional leadership capacity (Gonzalez et al. 2008). These patterns persist. A recent editorial in The Peninsula observed that while Qatarization remains a commendable objective, progress has often been hampered by \u201cvolatile preparation,\u201d particularly when nationals are promoted without systematic leadership development frameworks (The Peninsula 2024). These challenges are especially evident in critical sectors such as finance, energy, and infrastructure, where eVective middle management hinges not only on technical expertise but also on competencies like decision-making, conflict resolution, and team leadership. Yet, many institutions lack succession planning and structured development pipelines, resulting in bottlenecks and leadership vacuums. According to Bunglawala (2011), performance appraisal systems in many public organizations remain underdeveloped, leaving newly promoted nationals without constructive feedback mechanisms or clear growth trajectories. This not only weakens leadership performance but also disrupts team cohesion and operational eViciency.

These programs incorporate structured mentoring, rotational assignments, and real-time leadership challenges to ensure that promotions are earned and supported\u2014oVering a more sustainable alternative to quota-driven advancement.

However, the implementation of Qatarization policies has often prioritized meeting quota targets over aligning with the actual operational demands of the sector. Bunglawala (2011) notes that many national hires are assigned to administrative or support functions, with key technical and engineering roles still dominated by expatriates. According to QatarEnergy\u2019s 2023 Annual Review, the corporation emphasizes competency-based development and tailored training programs to prepare nationals for key positions.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_287765ae52e8", "text": "dominated by expatriates.

Initiatives such as the Ta\u2019sees onboarding program and scholarship schemes aim to support long-term career pathways in the energy industry (QatarEnergy 2024). However, qualitative studies highlight that many Qatari employees perceive their roles as symbolic, with limited opportunities for growth. Al-Yafei (2022) documents how structural challenges\u2014including unclear performance metrics, insuVicient mentoring, and limited access to meaningful technical experience\u2014hinder skill development and discourage motivation. Nationals in such roles often report feeling sidelined from substantive tasks and perceive constrained pathways for advancement. This suggests that despite achieving quota targets, sustainable localization and knowledge transfer remain elusive. 2.3.2 Banking and Financial Sector The mismatch is particularly pronounced in the finance and banking sector, where many national hires are assigned to customer-facing or clerical roles that do not align with their qualifications or aspirations. Said and Alhares 2021 (2021) report that graduates often lack essential workplace competencies such as critical thinking, interpersonal communication, and digital literacy\u2014skills increasingly required for strategic positions in the industry.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 22, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d203c0a597b5", "text": "raduates often lack essential workplace competencies such as critical thinking, interpersonal communication, and digital literacy\u2014skills increasingly required for strategic positions in the industry. Additional evidence from a case study of Alpha Bank in Qatar highlights persistent institutional barriers to talent progression, including the absence of clear development pathways and weak retention mechanisms (Dalloul, Amanulla, and Elbanna 2021). Moreover, Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna (2023) identify the emergence of the \u201cphantom employment\u201d phenomenon\u2014where Qataris are oVicially listed as employees to meet nationalization quotas but are not actively engaged in meaningful work. Participants in their study questioned the eVectiveness of this practice, citing its negative impact on engagement and future employability. While the banking sector has technically fulfilled quota obligations, this has sometimes come at the expense of genuine professional development and organizational integration. 2.3.3 Education Sector In the higher education sector, Qatarization faces unique challenges, particularly in aligning national employment with institutional needs and academic standards.

These barriers often lead to underemployment or assignment to administrative rather than instructional roles. Similarly, Mrad, Fayad, and Zeineh (2025) observe that while higher education contributes positively to Qatar\u2019s macroeconomic development, the link between advanced education and employability is tenuous when academic programs are not aligned with the labor market\u2019s skill demands. In practice, this disconnect limits the potential impact of Qatarization in academic institutions. Khodr (2011) further argues that Education City\u2019s international branch campuses\u2014 while elevating Qatar\u2019s academic reputation\u2014often operate independently of local workforce planning.

Addressing these challenges requires not only increased localization targets but also institutional reforms that promote mentorship, alignment between curricula and national needs, and sustainable pathways for academic careers. 2.4 Anecdotal Evidence from Qatari Employees and Employers Qualitative studies and institutional reports highlight enduring mismatches between workplace realities and the expectations of Qatari job seekers. Research indicates that many nationals perceive Qatarization primarily as a means to replace expatriates and secure leadership positions, particularly in the stable and well-paid public sector. This perception contributes to a \u201cwaithood phenomenon,\u201d where graduates may remain unemployed while waiting for an ideal government role, and can foster a sense of entitlement to guaranteed employment. This is reinforced by societal views that equate certain jobs with social status, leading to a reluctance to accept technical, vocational, or private-sector roles that are perceived as having lower status or less favorable working conditions (Al-Yafei 2022).

This skills misalignment is also documented in the finance and banking sector, where TVET programs are often not synchronized with real-world job demands, limiting graduates\u2019 readiness for roles that require a blend of technical and strong social skills (Said and Alhares 2021). Across sectors, employers report a consistent gap in essential non-technical competencies.

Several recurring patterns emerge: \u2022 Symbolic compliance through overstaQing: In many quota-driven roles, particularly within the public sector and state-linked industries, national employment targets are met by inflating staVing numbers without ensuring meaningful job responsibilities or productivity. This has led to instances of \u2018phantom employment\u2019 and inflated wage bills with minimal returns (Elsharnouby et al. 2023; IMF.

Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024; Gonzalez et al. 2008). \u2022 Premature promotions and vertical distortions: As documented in managerial and HR studies, nationals are often advanced too quickly to fulfill localization metrics, even when lacking suVicient experience or supervisory capacity. This not only undermines workplace hierarchies but also erodes the perceived meritocracy within institutions (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023; The Peninsula 2024). \u2022 Sectoral and occupational mismatch: Mismatches persist in priority sectors such as banking, industry, and education, where national graduates frequently lack technical, soft, or job-ready skills. Employers report significant gaps in preparedness, especially in vocational and STEM-linked roles. These issues are compounded by rigid labor regulations and limited collaboration between education providers and industry stakeholders (Said and Alhares 2021; Momani 2023; QatarEnergy 2024). \u2022 Motivational and aspirational dissonance: Among some job seekers, the misalignment stems from expectations of rapid advancement, preference for high-status roles, or aversion to perceived low-prestige jobs in the private sector.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5b966bf80562", "text": "dissonance: Among some job seekers, the misalignment stems from expectations of rapid advancement, preference for high-status roles, or aversion to perceived low-prestige jobs in the private sector. In turn, these attitudes are shaped by earlier socialization and policy signals that equate national employment with entitlement rather than development (Bunglawala 2011; Alyafei 2022). Taken together, these patterns reveal that the challenges of Qatarization are not merely technical or sector-specific\u2014they reflect broader structural tensions between policy ambitions and labor market realities. Addressing these issues will require a shift from compliance-based localization to capability-based integration, with reforms that promote eVective skilling, institutional coordination, and sustained national workforce engagement.

In the context of Qatar, Fatima and Elbanna (2025) demonstrate how workforce nationalization driven primarily by quota compliance results in poor alignment between employee capabilities and job demands, particularly in high-value sectors such as energy and finance. This leads to reduced operational eViciency and limited organizational performance. Al-Yafei (2022) finds similar ineViciencies in Qatar\u2019s state-owned enterprises, noting that poor alignment between technical job requirements and employee skillsets contributes to delays, rework, and operational underperformance.

These findings reinforce the need for targeted workforce planning and dynamic skill development frameworks to realize the full benefits of nationalization policies. 3.2 Decline in Employee Morale and Job Satisfaction The implementation of Qatarization, particularly where mismatches exist between policy intent and workplace reality, has been linked to a decline in morale and job satisfaction for both national and expatriate employees. For Qataris, a sense of demotivation can arise from perceived inequities in the labor market. Al-Mansoori (2018) notes that when nationals believe expatriates are given preferential treatment, it can lead to significant frustration. This is compounded by the findings in the Brookings Doha Center paper, which argues that a Qatarization strategy focused on \u201cquantity\u201d over \u201cquality\u201d and providing guaranteed job security can inadvertently reduce the motivation for nationals to pursue continuous skill development (Al-Subaiey 2010).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_69ad03ca0068", "text": "ion strategy focused on \u201cquantity\u201d over \u201cquality\u201d and providing guaranteed job security can inadvertently reduce the motivation for nationals to pursue continuous skill development (Al-Subaiey 2010). Furthermore, preconceived negative notions about the private sector can demotivate job seekers before they even enter the workforce, creating a cycle of disengagement when available roles do not meet their high expectations (Elsharnouby et al. 2023). The decline in expatriate morale, as detailed by Irfan et al. (2024), is not an isolated consequence but creates a negative feedback loop that can further impact the job satisfaction of Qatari employees and the overall eVectiveness of nationalization eVorts. An environment where experienced expatriates feel their positions are precarious is unlikely to foster the genuine mentorship and knowledge transfer essential for developing the national workforce. This can create a dysfunctional organizational climate characterized by mistrust and diminished collaboration, rather than the cohesive, high-performance culture needed to achieve strategic goals. For Qatari employees, particularly those early in their careers, this environment can be counterproductive; they may be entering workplaces where their international colleagues are disengaged or guarded, hindering their own professional integration and skill acquisition.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a828ae9551f9", "text": "vironment can be counterproductive; they may be entering workplaces where their international colleagues are disengaged or guarded, hindering their own professional integration and skill acquisition. Thus, the sources collectively suggest a significant unintended consequence: a policy designed to empower the national workforce can inadvertently create workplace dynamics that undermine morale across both expatriate and Qatari employees, ultimately constraining job satisfaction, impeding skill development, and diluting the very productivity gains the Qatarization strategy aims to secure. 3.3 High Turnover and Retention Challenges Skill mismatch, particularly the disconnect between employee qualifications and job demands, is a significant driver of high turnover intention. When employees perceive themselves as over- qualified for their roles, they often experience lower job satisfaction and develop a stronger intention to leave in search of better opportunities that align with their skills and career aspirations (Chen, Tang, and Su 2021). This phenomenon creates a persistent retention challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs and institutional instability. In the Gulf region, these challenges are amplified by specific nationalization dynamics.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 34, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_131a21b843fa", "text": "t retention challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs and institutional instability. In the Gulf region, these challenges are amplified by specific nationalization dynamics. As Elbanna and Fatima (2022) note, private sector firms often experience high turnover among national employees who leave for more attractive remuneration packages and perceived career prospects in the public sector. This cycle makes private companies reluctant to invest heavily in training nationals, fearing they will not see a return on their investment. For expatriate employees, the threat of replacement under Qatarization policies creates a climate of job insecurity that Page 13 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 directly harms their organizational commitment. Studies show that this uncertainty negatively aVects expatriates\u2019 desire to remain with their employers, as they live with the constant fear of being replaced (Irfan et al. 2024). The impact of these dynamics is evident across sectors. In the UAE, for example, ZeVane and Shaker Bani Melhem (2017) found that public sector employees report higher job satisfaction and lower turnover intention compared to their private sector counterparts, partly due to greater job security and benefits. Conversely, a lack of trust and perceived organizational support in the private sector directly fuels higher turnover.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 35, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0fe12b2ccf91", "text": "ir private sector counterparts, partly due to greater job security and benefits. Conversely, a lack of trust and perceived organizational support in the private sector directly fuels higher turnover. This dynamic is also reflected in the organizational- level study by Al-Mansoori (2018), which found a positive correlation between Qatarization strategy implementation and employee motivation but also noted that retention remains a key challenge. Collectively, these findings indicate that skill mismatch and misaligned expectations do not merely aVect individual performance but are systemic drivers of turnover. For both national and expatriate workforces, the failure to provide clear career paths, equitable rewards, and a stable, supportive work environment results in a cycle of disengagement and departure, undermining long-term human capital development. 3.4 Institutional and Economic Consequences At a systemic level, skill mismatch contributes to the ineVicient allocation of human capital, which can have significant negative consequences for productivity and long-term economic resilience. OECD research by McGowan and Andrews (2015b, 2017) demonstrates a direct link between the prevalence of skill mismatch\u2014particularly over-skilling\u2014and lower aggregate labor productivity.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 36, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_897a6bd25625", "text": "c resilience. OECD research by McGowan and Andrews (2015b, 2017) demonstrates a direct link between the prevalence of skill mismatch\u2014particularly over-skilling\u2014and lower aggregate labor productivity. Their analysis suggests that a high share of over-skilled workers can \u201cclog up\u201d the labor market, trapping valuable talent in less productive firms and making it more diVicult for innovative, high-productivity firms to attract the human capital needed to expand. This ineVicient allocation of skills acts as a drag on the economy\u2019s overall productive capacity. Furthermore, nationalization policies centered on quotas can inadvertently create institutional and economic distortions. Elbanna and Fatima (2022) argue that when nationalization is pursued primarily through a \u201cnumbers game\u201d of meeting hiring targets, it can lead to \u201cceremonial adoption\u201d by private firms. Companies may hire nationals simply to comply with regulations and maintain legitimacy, rather than focusing on building a competitive local workforce. This can result in the hiring of underqualified individuals or the creation of roles that do not contribute meaningfully to productivity, thereby undermining the economic objectives of nationalization. These international and regional findings are particularly salient for Qatar, where the structure of the labor market presents unique challenges.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 37, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f41bbb620b55", "text": "dermining the economic objectives of nationalization.

Simultaneously, the pressures of quota fulfillment could lead to the \u201cceremonial adoption\u201d described by Elbanna and Fatima (2022), where the statistical goals of Qatarization are met without achieving the more crucial objective of enhancing national productivity.

Policy Recommendations and Strategic Reforms To mitigate the negative outcomes of skill mismatches identified under Qatarization, this section proposes a multi-layered reform agenda. It emphasizes demand-driven training, evidence-based placement, and institutional collaboration, with practical mechanisms to align national employment goals with labor market realities. 4.1 Demand-Driven Education and Training 4.1.1 Curricular Alignment with Industry Needs A core element of Qatar\u2019s demand-driven education strategy is the imperative to align vocational and higher education systems with real-time industry demands.

However, research consistently reveals significant gaps between the skills possessed by graduates and the competencies required by the nation\u2019s evolving labor market. A study of Qatar\u2019s postsecondary TVET institutions found a clear \u201cmismatch between the TVET curricula and the 21st century skills required by the labor market,\u201d particularly in crucial non-technical areas like communication, leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork (Said, Pavlova, and Wheeler 2021). This challenge has been recognized at the policy level for over a decade; early educational reforms like Education For a New Era were explicitly designed to equip the Qatari workforce with these very skills to meet the country\u2019s changing needs (Romanowski and Nasser 2012). A primary reason for this persistent gap is the weak linkage between educational providers and industry. A comprehensive study of Qatar\u2019s TVET system by Sa\u0131d (2021) documented a \u2018major Page 15 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 mismatch between the perceptions of TVET program leaders and employers\u2019 managers.\u2019 The research revealed that while employers prioritized social skills and digital literacy, TVET programs placed greater emphasis on theoretical knowledge like mathematical reasoning.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 41, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0482942861ff", "text": "yers\u2019 managers.\u2019 The research revealed that while employers prioritized social skills and digital literacy, TVET programs placed greater emphasis on theoretical knowledge like mathematical reasoning. This misalignment is exacerbated by a documented \u2018low level of engagement and collaboration\u2019 between companies and TVET institutions, hindering the co-development of relevant curricula (Said, Pavlova, and Wheeler 2020). An eVective solution, strongly supported by their findings, is the establishment of robust, formal partnerships. This includes creating industry advisory boards to guide curriculum design, expanding internship and work placement opportunities, and establishing regular feedback loops to ensure educational programs remain responsive to market demands. As Qatar continues its transition toward a knowledge-based economy, such strategic alignment is not merely beneficial but essential for producing a generation of graduates who are both technically proficient and equipped with the critical thinking and adaptive skills necessary for innovation and global competitiveness (Zaidan et al. 2025; Alshawi, Ali, and Ra\u00efq 2023). These policy goals are being actively pursued through a growing ecosystem of strategic partnerships. At the forefront is Qatar University (QU), which has positioned itself as the nation\u2019s \u201cprincipal reservoir of knowledge and expertise\u201d by explicitly aligning its strategic mission with the economic diversification goals of QNV 2030 (Wazen 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 42, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e64ee2c49495", "text": "h has positioned itself as the nation\u2019s \u201cprincipal reservoir of knowledge and expertise\u201d by explicitly aligning its strategic mission with the economic diversification goals of QNV 2030 (Wazen 2025). This high-level strategy is implemented through tangible initiatives, such as the College of Business and Economics (CBE) formalizing agreements with the Civil Service and Government Development Bureau to shape career training, and with industry leaders like Qatar Shell to foster youth entrepreneurship through its \u2018Shell Intilaaqah\u2019 program. The CBE is also proactively revamping its curriculum by integrating business simulations, technology like 3D printing, and partnerships with platforms like Coursera to enhance job readiness skills (CBE 2024). This model of deep industry integration is echoed across Qatar\u2019s educational landscape. Branch campuses in Education City, such as Texas A&M University at Qatar and Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, maintain active collaborations with the energy and finance sectors to co-develop research and talent pipelines (Texas a&M University at Qatar n.d.; CMU-Q 2025). On a global scale, Qatar\u2019s engagement in initiatives like the IIE-WISE consortium on AI in higher education signals a commitment to not only addressing current skill gaps but also anticipating future workforce needs (IIE 2024).

For decades, Qatar\u2019s education system has struggled to produce graduates with the necessary skills to meet the demands of a competitive global market, a challenge rooted in a systemic misalignment between educational supply and labor market demand (Al-Subaiey 2010). To close this gap, international best practice points to the critical role of structured, work-based education (WBL), including apprenticeships and on- the-job training. These models provide a direct mechanism for aligning learning with industry needs, a long-standing policy challenge in the Arab region (ILO 2008). The benefits of such programs are well-documented globally.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 45, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_774a81883a33", "text": "odels provide a direct mechanism for aligning learning with industry needs, a long-standing policy challenge in the Arab region (ILO 2008). The benefits of such programs are well-documented globally. The International Labour Organization emphasizes that WBL enables students to acquire not only relevant technical competencies but also a suite of transferable skills, including communication, problem-solving, and teamwork (ILO 2022). Evidence shows that work-based education leads to smoother transitions into sustainable employment and provides employers with a pipeline of \u2018work-ready\u2019 talent (Osborne et al. 2020). Indeed, a multi-country ILO study found that students in combined work-study programs transitioned to employment significantly faster\u2014an average of 1.9 months\u2014than those in purely institution-based training (20.1 months) (Comyn and Brewer 2018). Successfully implementing these models, however, requires a coordinated and supportive ecosystem. Merely identifying skill gaps is insuVicient; a structured policy response is necessary. Best practices outlined by the ILO and other national bodies stress the need for a clearly articulated policy and governance framework to overcome barriers to eVective WBL (ILO 2022; Osborne et al. 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 46, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_103f4b5b43c8", "text": "practices outlined by the ILO and other national bodies stress the need for a clearly articulated policy and governance framework to overcome barriers to eVective WBL (ILO 2022; Osborne et al. 2020). This includes establishing strong partnerships between VET institutions, Page 17 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 industry, and social partners to ensure curricula are demand-driven and that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. Furthermore, policy levers are crucial for incentivizing participation. Financial instruments such as training levies, wage subsidies, and payroll tax rebates can encourage businesses to invest in apprenticeships and prevent the \u201cpoaching\u201d of skilled workers by firms that do not contribute to training (Osborne et al. 2020). Equally important are basic legal standards to protect students during WBL periods, covering aspects like remuneration, working hours, and health and safety (ILO 2022). For Qatar, adopting such evidence-based frameworks is crucial to move beyond identifying skill gaps and toward building a truly integrated, demand-driven training system that supports its national development ambitions.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_942e9bb9e79e", "text": "such evidence-based frameworks is crucial to move beyond identifying skill gaps and toward building a truly integrated, demand-driven training system that supports its national development ambitions. 4.2 Career Counseling and Early Guidance 4.2.1 Sector-Embedded Career Services A significant challenge for Qatar\u2019s human capital development is that Qatari youth often exhibit a \u201cfragmented career orientation,\u201d where their career aspirations, their assessment of the importance of work, and their decisiveness about the future are not coherently aligned (Khattab et al. 2022). Decisions are frequently driven by powerful societal expectations and cultural norms rather than by informed, individual guidance (Momani 2025). This results in a persistent disconnect where students may express high interest in certain fields, such as science and mathematics, yet this interest does not translate into a corresponding aspiration to pursue a career in those areas, particularly when faced with the strong allure of high-status public sector employment (Sellami et al. 2017; Sellami et al. 2023). Embedding structured career counseling within schools and universities is a critical mechanism to address this fragmentation. EVective guidance can help dismantle misconceptions and provide a realistic understanding of various sectors.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 48, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d108b85e68fb", "text": "ng within schools and universities is a critical mechanism to address this fragmentation. EVective guidance can help dismantle misconceptions and provide a realistic understanding of various sectors. For example, targeted information could correct negative perceptions surrounding industries like hospitality, which are often overlooked due to concerns about low pay and demanding work conditions (Al-Mohannadi 2025). Research on healthcare students in Qatar demonstrates that when institutional support\u2014including dedicated faculty and academic advisors\u2014is available, it serves as a key facilitator in helping students navigate complex career paths and overcome challenges (Yasin et al. 2024). Therefore, building a national framework for career counseling requires more than simply oVering advice; it necessitates creating a formal, integrated system. Drawing on international best practice, this involves establishing strong networks and partnerships between educational institutions, industry bodies, and social partners (ILO 2022). Such a sector-embedded approach ensures that career guidance is not abstract but is directly linked to the evolving needs of Qatar\u2019s economy, thereby helping students make choices that align their skills and ambitions with tangible opportunities.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 49, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_accf7ea56c4b", "text": "reer guidance is not abstract but is directly linked to the evolving needs of Qatar\u2019s economy, thereby helping students make choices that align their skills and ambitions with tangible opportunities. 4.2.2 Psychometric and Competency Assessments At a strategic level, the eVective use of psychometric and competency assessments aligns directly with the priorities set by major international organizations for tackling skills mismatch. The OECD, for instance, emphasizes that for countries to thrive, they must move beyond simply tracking educational attainment and focus on developing and eVectively utilizing a broad set of skills, including transversal cognitive abilities like critical thinking and problem-solving alongside Page 18 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 social and emotional skills (OECD 2019). The OECD Skills Strategy framework explicitly calls for policies that \u201creduce skills imbalances\u201d and \u201cmake intensive use of skills in the economy,\u201d goals that are predicated on having reliable methods to assess competencies. In this context, competency-based assessments serve as a critical instrument for bridging the gap between education and employment. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reinforces this by advocating for VET systems that are demand-driven and produce work-ready graduates.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 50, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_21c45ba2b173", "text": "r bridging the gap between education and employment. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reinforces this by advocating for VET systems that are demand-driven and produce work-ready graduates. Central to this is the implementation of Competency-Based Training (CBT), a structured system designed to ensure learners acquire the specific skills and knowledge required for a given occupation (ILO 2022). Job placement tools like psychometric and job knowledge tests are the very mechanisms used to validate these competencies at the point of entry, ensuring that the skills developed through education are the ones demanded by the labor market. However, the implementation of such assessments requires careful consideration. While they oVer a systematic method for comparing candidates (Charles and Florah 2021), research also highlights their potential to introduce bias and disadvantage certain groups if not applied holistically. Studies in health professions, for example, show conflicting data on their predictive validity and underscore the risk of excluding otherwise qualified candidates from under- represented backgrounds ((Jakirlic, Ooley, and Hoppe 2021). This presents a critical challenge for a national policy like Qatarization, which aims to be inclusive. A promising approach to mitigate these risks while retaining the benefits of assessment is the use of practice employment tests.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 51, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_65c8efe94393", "text": "e for a national policy like Qatarization, which aims to be inclusive. A promising approach to mitigate these risks while retaining the benefits of assessment is the use of practice employment tests. Research by Campion, Campion, and Campion (2019) demonstrates that oVering practice tests can simultaneously improve outcomes for both employers and job seekers. For candidates, it reduces uncertainty and provides a short-term opportunity to build human capital. For organizations, it results in a higher-quality applicant pool and has been shown to reduce adverse impact against minority groups. Integrating such evidence-based tools ensures that the drive to meet nationalization targets is supported by a commitment to eVective and equitable placement, thereby fostering greater employee success and long-term retention. 4.3 Flexible Quota Mechanisms and Implementation 4.3.1 Strategic Quota DiMerentiation Rigid, one-size-fits-all quota systems can compel firms to prioritize compliance over performance, leading to unintended negative consequences. Research on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Nitaqat program, for example, found that firms below their mandated quotas often hired lower-wage, lower-skilled nationals and reduced their overall labor force, which negatively impacted their export values and increased their likelihood of exiting the market (Cort\u00e9s, Kasoolu, and Pan 2021). This illustrates how a focus on a \u201cnumbers game\u201d can undermine genuine human capital development.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 52, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d05e6cfbb5f1", "text": "r export values and increased their likelihood of exiting the market (Cort\u00e9s, Kasoolu, and Pan 2021). This illustrates how a focus on a \u201cnumbers game\u201d can undermine genuine human capital development. Indeed, merely increasing the proportion of national staV does not guarantee better performance and may even adversely aVect non-financial outcomes if not managed eVectively (Fatima and Elbanna 2025). A more eVective strategy involves tailoring nationalization targets to the specific realities of diVerent economic sectors, acknowledging the existing skills mismatch between the national labor supply and employer needs. Studies in Qatar have highlighted a significant gap between the skills taught in technical and vocational education (TVET) programs and the competencies Page 19 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 demanded by industries like finance and banking (Said and Alhares 2021). Therefore, a flexible quota mechanism should allow for exemptions or adjusted targets in roles with documented shortages of qualified nationals. This flexibility, however, must be coupled with a commitment to long-term human capital investment. Fostering eVective workforce integration through strategic training and educational reforms is essential to ensure that nationalization policies build true capability rather than just enforcing statistical compliance (Fatima and Elbanna 2025; Said and Alhares 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 53, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5a4d4f757e04", "text": "and educational reforms is essential to ensure that nationalization policies build true capability rather than just enforcing statistical compliance (Fatima and Elbanna 2025; Said and Alhares 2021). 4.3.2 Instruments for Phased and Agile Implementation To operationalize a more flexible and eVective approach to nationalization, policymakers can employ specific instruments like temporary waivers and targeted pilot programs. These tools move beyond rigid compliance, focusing instead on long-term human capital development. Temporary waivers could allow a firm to defer strict quota fulfillment in exchange for verifiable investments in skill-building, such as sponsoring a national student through a multi-year degree or a structured apprenticeship program. This approach directly addresses the concern that quotas can lead to hiring under-qualified nationals by ensuring that when placements occur, they are aligned with genuine, developed competencies (Elbanna and Fatima 2022). It transforms the policy from a simple headcount requirement into a mechanism for public-private partnership in talent creation. Similarly, pilot programs in strategic sectors like technology, finance, or specialized industrial fields can serve as low-risk testbeds for new nationalization strategies. By monitoring these focused initiatives, policymakers can gather crucial data on what works, refining policies based on real-world outcomes before a nationwide rollout (Elbanna 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 54, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_993196b73bc1", "text": "ion strategies. By monitoring these focused initiatives, policymakers can gather crucial data on what works, refining policies based on real-world outcomes before a nationwide rollout (Elbanna 2022). This evidence-based approach is essential for designing policies that eVectively balance national employment goals with the complex economic and operational realities of key industries (Durand-Lasserve 2022). 4.4 Public\u2013Private Coordination and Institutional Oversight 4.4.1 Inter-Ministerial Talent Councils To ensure successful policy implementation and institutional oversight, a cross-ministerial coordination council is essential. The International Labour Organization (ILO) stresses that achieving policy coherence for sustainable development (SDG 17) depends on such mechanisms, championing a \u201ctripartite\u201d approach involving government, employers, and workers in a continuous social dialogue (ILO 2016). The need for such a structure is amplified by the intricate dynamics of labor nationalization. As economic modeling of the Saudi Arabian labor market shows, policies like quotas, levies on foreign workers, and wage subsidies have complex, sometimes counterintuitive, eVects on employment due to the large public-private wage gap and other market frictions. Relying on simple headcount metrics can obscure these realities and lead to ineVective policy (Durand- Lasserve 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 55, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_879b12b27615", "text": "employment due to the large public-private wage gap and other market frictions.

While financial incentives like wage subsidies are common tools, their eVectiveness can be blunted by pre- existing quota systems (Durand-Lasserve 2022). For example, the Nitaqat policy in Saudi Arabia, which relied heavily on quotas, successfully increased the number of Saudi nationals in the private sector but did so by encouraging firms to hire lower-wage, lower-skilled workers to meet headcount targets, undermining firm productivity and the goal of upskilling (Cort\u00e9s, Kasoolu, and Pan 2021). EVective upskilling therefore requires a more sophisticated governance network. This involves public-sector bodies playing a directing role\u2014perhaps by funding training grants through a mechanism like the Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF)\u2014while private-sector intermediaries, such as industry associations, play a representing role by aggregating employer needs and ensuring training is relevant, a model proven successful in vocational education systems (Caves and Oswald-Egg 2023). 4.5 Competency-Based Placement and Lifelong Learning 4.5.1 Certification-Aligned Recruitment A key challenge in labor nationalization is transitioning employers from a compliance mindset, focused on meeting hiring quotas, to a strategic one centered on capability-building.

While governments utilize incentives to encourage this shift, their design and the institutional context in which they are deployed are critical for success. \u2022 The Employer\u2019s Perspective: Qualifications vs. Competence: Research consistently shows that while employers use formal qualifications as a crucial screening tool for new recruits\u2014where other information is scarce\u2014and to manage regulatory compliance, they often place a higher value on demonstrated experience and \u201cemployability skills\u201d like attitude and communication (Ridoutt et al. 2005). This creates a significant challenge in the Arab States, where a well-documented \u201cskills mismatch\u201d means that even certified individuals may not possess the skills employers need. The fact that unemployment is often highest for those with secondary-level education points to a disconnect between training provision and labor market demand (ILO 2008). Simply mandating certifications without addressing their relevance may not solve the underlying issue. \u2022 The Modern Role of National Qualifications Frameworks (NQFs): To bridge this gap, modern NQFs are being designed as comprehensive and permeable systems. As Cedefop (2025) notes, the role of NQFs is expanding beyond simply cataloging formal degrees. They are increasingly structured to support lifelong learning by creating pathways between formal, non-formal, and informal learning.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 58, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1d0f48f3d0a8", "text": "ole of NQFs is expanding beyond simply cataloging formal degrees.

By defining qualifications based on learning outcomes (what a person knows and can do) rather than just Page 21 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 9th, 2025 educational inputs, an NQF allows for a more flexible and realistic assessment of an individual\u2019s capabilities. For Qatar, this presents a powerful opportunity to directly address the skill mismatches hindering Qatarization and advance the Human Development pillar of Qatar National Vision 2030. By strengthening and expanding Qatar\u2019s own National Qualifications Framework, policymakers can create a trusted, unified standard. This framework would serve multiple strategic goals: it would provide a common language for employers and educational institutions to co-design relevant curricula; it would give the private sector greater confidence in the competencies of Qatari graduates; and it would guide students toward qualifications that are in high demand, fostering a truly knowledge-based economy.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 59, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_01f3c45684c9", "text": "ve the private sector greater confidence in the competencies of Qatari graduates; and it would guide students toward qualifications that are in high demand, fostering a truly knowledge-based economy. Success requires elevating the NQF from a technical registry to the cornerstone of the national talent strategy, ensuring that recruitment is not just certification- aligned, but truly competency-based and integrated into a national vision for lifelong learning. 4.5.2 Continuous Professional Development While competency-based recruitment is critical for initial job placement, a sustainable Qatarization strategy must also foster long-term career progression. This requires moving beyond entry-level qualifications to a system that supports continuous professional growth throughout a national\u2019s career. \u2022 The Role of Individualized Professional Development: A proven mechanism for this is the Individualized Professional Development (IPD) plan, a structured tool that helps employees set clear career goals and identify the specific training and experiences needed to achieve them (Head Start 2025). Such plans formalize the career pathway, ensuring that development is intentional rather than accidental. For the employee, the plan provides a clear roadmap for advancement; for the employer, it aligns individual growth with the organization\u2019s strategic needs, ensuring a better return on training investments (OPM n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 60, "total_chunks": 92, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q3_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e960efd1e51e", "text": "the plan provides a clear roadmap for advancement; for the employer, it aligns individual growth with the organization\u2019s strategic needs, ensuring a better return on training investments (OPM n.d.). \u2022 Fostering a Culture of Lifelong Learning: Beyond the plan itself, a successful career development strategy hinges on cultivating a mindset of lifelong learning. In a rapidly evolving global economy, the ability to adapt, reskill, and embrace change is essential for sustained employability. As Johnson (2023) notes, continuous learning is no longer a periodic activity but a crucial \u201cattitude for career and life success.\u201d By encouraging this mindset, individuals take ownership of their development, proactively seeking new skills to remain relevant and valuable in their fields. To ensure the long-term success of Qatarization, these principles should be embedded into the national talent framework. It is recommended that Qatar\u2019s human resource policies encourage the adoption of Individualized Professional Development (IPD) plans, particularly in strategic sectors targeted by Qatar National Vision 2030.

Conclusion The advancement of Qatarization in high-skilled sectors represents a strategic intersection of governmental vision, private-sector collaboration, and cultural adaptation. While substantial strides have been achieved in increasing the presence of nationals in the workforce, the evidence reviewed in this report indicates that when nationalization is pursued without a concurrent, strategic focus on skill alignment and human capital integration, it can generate significant unintended ineViciencies.

Conceived under the leadership of the Father Amir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, and launched in 2008, this long-term development plan represents a strategic response to the inherent vulnerabilities of a hydrocarbon-dependent economy (GCO n.d.). It seeks to transition Qatar to a diversified, competitive, and knowledge- based economy, ensuring prosperity for future generations (GSDP 2008; Abduljawad 2013). This transition is not merely an economic choice but a political and social necessity, central to the state\u2019s long-term sustainability. It represents a foundational shift in the national economic model, aimed at moving beyond resource-dependency and empowering a future-ready workforce to drive growth and prosperity (GSDP 2008; PSA 2024). Central to this vision is the Human Development Pillar, a foundational element that aims to cultivate a skilled and productive workforce capable of steering the nation\u2019s diversified future (GSDP 2008). This pillar is not an isolated objective; it is an integrated strategy encompassing the creation of \u201ca world-class educational system\u201d and a comprehensive national health strategy to ensure a physically and mentally healthy population, viewing these as prerequisites for sustainable human capital development (Mohamed et al. 2022; GSDP 2008).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0ab84acce3ef", "text": "mprehensive national health strategy to ensure a physically and mentally healthy population, viewing these as prerequisites for sustainable human capital development (Mohamed et al. 2022; GSDP 2008).

The ultimate goal is to empower Qatari citizens to play a leading role in all sectors of the economy, thereby ensuring long-term sustainable development and reducing dependency on expatriate labor, which has historically constituted the vast majority of the country\u2019s workforce (Al-Thani 2024). The policy addresses the critical challenge of rectifying the structural imbalance where public sector employment has been the default career path for many nationals (Bunglawala 2011). The Third National Development Strategy (NDS-3), which operationalizes the final phase of QNV 2030, further sharpens this focus, setting ambitious targets to accelerate private sector-led growth and enhance the economic participation of Qatari citizens, including women (Randeree 2012; PSA 2024; MoL 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_159ebcc736d6", "text": "sharpens this focus, setting ambitious targets to accelerate private sector-led growth and enhance the economic participation of Qatari citizens, including women (Randeree 2012; PSA 2024; MoL 2024).

It is oiicially defined by state entities as a strategic process \u201cto provide Qatari nationals with quality training and meaningful career opportunities to develop their abilities and capacities in order to assume key positions in the industry\u201d (QatarEnergy n.d.). Far from being a simple employment quota system, it is a comprehensive national human resource management strategy aimed at building long-term, sustainable national capability (Randeree 2012; GSDP 2012). The policy\u2019s core objectives are multidimensional, focusing on aligning educational outcomes with labor market needs, fostering talent from a young age through scholarships and sponsorships, and ultimately maximizing the potential of the national workforce (QatarEnergy n.d.; GSDP 2012).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_363fb904393b", "text": "omes with labor market needs, fostering talent from a young age through scholarships and sponsorships, and ultimately maximizing the potential of the national workforce (QatarEnergy n.d.; GSDP 2012).

The mandates for Qatarization are tiered, sector-specific, and have evolved significantly over time. Historically, the most stringent requirements have been in the energy and industrial sectors, the bedrock of the Qatari economy. Here, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) like QatarEnergy have long-standing targets aiming for at least 50% Qatarization across their operations (QatarEnergy n.d.). Similar, though often less publicly specified, quotas have been in place for the banking, finance, and telecommunications sectors. For years, enforcement mechanisms have included visa processing restrictions and potential fines for non-compliant companies, creating a \u201cpull\u201d factor for Qatari talent into a private sector that has historically been less attractive than secure public sector employment (Budhwar et al. 2019).

More recently, Qatar has accelerated its nationalization eiorts with a more robust legal framework. In 2023, the government approved a new draft law to regulate the nationalization of jobs in the private sector, signaling a more assertive phase of the policy (Sadek 2023). This culminated in the landmark Law No. (12) of 2024 on the Nationalization of Jobs in the Private Sector. This law introduces explicit and ambitious targets for companies subject to the Labor Law. Key mandates include the nationalization of 60% of all human resources and administration positions and a broader target of 20% nationalization of the total workforce in applicable companies (ITA 2024). To ensure compliance, the Ministry of Labour has been actively engaging with various sectors, including real estate, financial services, and insurance, outlining the new requirements and the government\u2019s commitment to developing national cadres (MoL 2024b, 2024c, 2024d).

A significant fault line appears between large organizations \u201cincluding multinational corporations (MNCs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\u201d and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). This report employs the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm as its core analytical lens. The RBV posits that a firm\u2019s competitive advantage is Page 3 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 30th, 2025 derived not just from its market positioning, but from its unique and valuable internal resources and capabilities (Barney 1991; Mahoney and Pandian 1992). For a resource to be a source of sustained competitive advantage, it should be valuable, rare, diiicult to imitate, and non- substitutable (VRIN), a framework that helps explain why firms with superior resources can outperform others (Barney 1991). Applying this lens, large organizations in Qatar, particularly state-owned enterprises like QatarEnergy and its industrial aiiliates, possess significant \u201corganizational slack\u201d, abundant financial, human, and political resources (George 2005).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_61d6b59f6c5e", "text": "atar, particularly state-owned enterprises like QatarEnergy and its industrial aiiliates, possess significant \u201corganizational slack\u201d, abundant financial, human, and political resources (George 2005). This is evident in their leadership of high- level bodies like the Strategic Qatarization Steering Committee and the detailed reporting on human capital investments in their corporate disclosures (QatarEnergy Qatarization 2024; MPHC 2025). This deep pool of resources allows them to absorb the significant costs associated with nationalization policies and integrate them strategically into their long-term plans (Budhwar et al. 2019). They can dedicate capital and specialized personnel to Qatarization \u201cdeveloping extensive training programs, oiering premium compensation, and managing complex stakeholder relations\u201d without jeopardizing their core operations (Bateman and Waxin 2016). Conversely, SMEs are, by definition, resource-constrained. This challenge is so central to Qatar\u2019s economic diversification strategy that the state has established numerous support mechanisms, such as the Qatar Development Bank\u2019s (QDB) credit guarantee program (Al-Dhameen) and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\u2019s strategies to boost the SME sector (QDB n.d.; MOCI 2025; The Peninsula 2025c).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2aa007fb215c", "text": "as the Qatar Development Bank\u2019s (QDB) credit guarantee program (Al-Dhameen) and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\u2019s strategies to boost the SME sector (QDB n.d.; MOCI 2025; The Peninsula 2025c). Despite this state-level support, the mandates of Qatarization can still represent a substantial operational and financial burden for individual SMEs, often shifting their response from one of strategic integration to one of reactive compliance (Budhwar et al. 2019). This report will provide an extended literature overview and analysis of this dichotomy, exploring how these two organizational archetypes adapt their HR and training budgets to accommodate Qatarization.

Large Organizations: Strategic Integration and Resource-Intensive Investment For large organizations operating in Qatar, particularly SOEs and major MNCs, Qatarization is not merely a compliance issue; it is a core component of their corporate strategy, stakeholder management, and long-term license to operate.

In the context of Qatar, this strategic role is amplified, as HR is tasked with aligning the company\u2019s talent strategy with the nation\u2019s development goals (Arugay 2021; QIIB 2024). This alignment is critical, as the success of national strategies like QNV 2030 depends on the institutionalization of Qatarization at the organizational level (Arugay 2021).

Performance management systems are designed to link individual and team objectives directly to the strategic goals of the organization, which are, in turn, aligned with the national vision (QDB 2021). This is evident in the formal mechanisms these organizations employ, such as the Qatarization Steering Committees, which oversee strategic workforce planning, talent pipelines, and succession planning to ensure a steady supply of qualified nationals for key roles (Qatar Career Fair 2015). This top-down commitment ensures that Qatarization is viewed as an investment in the future of the business and its social contract with the state, rather than an unavoidable cost. This strategic posture is often highlighted in their annual corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reports, framing their eiorts as a contribution to national progress (QatarEnergy 2024b; Qatar Airways 2023). 2.2 Budgetary Allocations: Dedicated Funds for Nationalization 2.2.1 Proactive and Structural Budgeting The most significant diierentiator for large organizations is their budgetary approach.

This practice reflects a sophisticated understanding of human capital as a strategic asset rather than just an expense. This approach is conceptually supported by the emerging field of Human Capital Accounting, which argues for formally recognizing the value of workforce investments on a company\u2019s balance sheet to better reflect its long-term health and sustainability (Suwarno, Fitria, and Azhar 2023; Chan 2020). The budget is formulated based on strategic workforce planning models that project future talent needs, map them against current demographics, and identify the gaps that must be filled by Qatari nationals. These models increasingly use predictive analytics to make the budgeting process more precise and forward-looking (Local Government Association 2020).

This corporate spending is situated within a broader national context of massive state investment in human capital. For instance, the Qatar 2024 general budget allocates 20% of its QAR 200.9 billion budget to the health and education sectors.

These are not merely entry-level jobs but comprehensive, multi-year programs \u201ctypically lasting two to five years\u201d designed to accelerate the development of fresh Qatari graduates into competent professionals and future leaders. These programs are a direct response to the challenge of bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical workplace application, a common issue in workforce nationalization eiorts (AL-Mansoori 2018). The design of these GDPs is highly structured and multifaceted, incorporating principles of organizational learning to ensure eiective knowledge transfer and skill acquisition (Henn and Hatzl 2020). Key components typically involve: \u2022 Rotational Assignments: Graduates are carefully rotated through various departments, including core operations, support functions, and strategic planning, to provide a holistic understanding of the business.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 18, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e46d5811b0c6", "text": "al Assignments: Graduates are carefully rotated through various departments, including core operations, support functions, and strategic planning, to provide a holistic understanding of the business. This approach is central to the graduate programs at major energy firms like Shell and QatarEnergy, where engineers and commercial graduates gain exposure to diierent facets of the business value chain (Shell in Qatar n.d.; QatarEnergy n.d.). The eiectiveness of job rotation is supported by meta-analytic research, which shows its positive impact on skill development and performance, though it also highlights potential downsides like the initial dip in performance as employees adjust to new roles (Fakhouri 2019). This strategy enables employees to develop a broader range of competencies, making them more versatile and preparing them for future leadership roles (Laleh et al., 2022). \u2022 Structured Classroom Learning: Custom-designed modules focus on developing both \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d skills.

This mentorship is crucial for navigating the corporate culture and making the transition from an academic to a professional mindset (Basten and Haamann 2018). This practice directly addresses a key challenge in knowledge-intensive industries: transferring experience-based wisdom that is not easily documented (Fakhouri 2019). Organizations like Ooredoo and QNB heavily publicize these programs on their career portals, positioning them as a key attraction for national talent.

Senior managers, often experienced expatriates, are incentivized (and sometimes mandated) to mentor and coach junior Qatari colleagues. This is directly linked to succession planning, a critical process for ensuring organizational sustainability and leadership continuity (Ingale 2024). For every key senior or mid- level position held by an expatriate, the HR department, in conjunction with line management, is required to identify and develop one or more Qatari nationals as potential successors. This \u201cheir Page 9 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 30th, 2025 apparent\u201d system creates a clear pathway for career progression and makes the goal of replacing expatriates with qualified locals a tangible and measurable process, often reviewed by the board of directors.

This process, however, is not without complexity. The multicultural work environment, where expatriate mentors guide privileged Qatari mentees, creates unique power dynamics (Fakhouri 2019). Research shows that the eiectiveness of such relationships is not guaranteed by ethnic or racial similarity alone, but by a combination of factors including trust, respect, and organizational support (Ensher and Murphy 1997). Studies in Qatari government agencies confirm that robust HR planning, including mentorship and succession planning, is a key driver for developing the core competencies required by the national development strategy (Al Thani, Kamri, and Abughazaleh 2025). The motivation for an expatriate to mentor a national successor can be understood through the lens of social exchange theory, where the mentor\u2019s investment is reciprocated with professional recognition and a sense of contributing to a national strategic goal (Al Ariss 2014; Shahiri, Husin, and Khain 2023). This structured approach to succession is a direct response to Qatar\u2019s strategic imperative to empower its national workforce and ensure long-term sustainability (Anani, Rizk, and Aydemir 2024). The Civil Service and Government Development Bureau (CGB) in Qatar has implemented programs that require government agencies to prepare and qualify Qatari employees to fill leadership and specialized roles, further formalizing the succession planning process (CGB 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_65d15d66c9fc", "text": "implemented programs that require government agencies to prepare and qualify Qatari employees to fill leadership and specialized roles, further formalizing the succession planning process (CGB 2022).

Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs): Compliance Burden and Resource Scarcity SMEs form the backbone of economic diversification and private-sector employment in Qatar, crucial for achieving the goals of QNV 2030. According to the Qatar Chamber, SMEs represent 97% of registered private sector companies in the country (Qatar Chamber 2022). This makes them vital engines for job creation and innovation, a fact underscored by their significant contribution to the nation\u2019s non-oil GDP and their role in the state\u2019s transition to a knowledge- based economy (KUNA 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_521ce0b76f20", "text": "s for job creation and innovation, a fact underscored by their significant contribution to the nation\u2019s non-oil GDP and their role in the state\u2019s transition to a knowledge- based economy (KUNA 2025). However, their operational reality is starkly diierent from that of large corporations, making their response to Qatarization mandates one of challenge, constraint, and often, compromise. 3.1 The Critical Role and Inherent Vulnerability of SMEs in Qatar SMEs operate on thin margins, with limited access to capital and a constant focus on short-term survival and cash flow management. A 2011 white paper for the Qatar Development Bank identified \u201caccess to financing\u201d as one of the most problematic factors for doing business in Page 10 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 30th, 2025 Qatar, second only to \u201crestrictive labor regulations\u201d (Mammadov 2011). Their smaller scale means they lack the economies of scale in administration, procurement, and, crucially, human resources. While vital for the Qatari economy\u2019s dynamism, this inherent vulnerability makes them particularly sensitive to regulatory costs and labor market policies. Any expenditure that does not contribute directly to the immediate bottom line is viewed with extreme caution. This sensitivity is highlighted in a 2023 Mastercard survey, which revealed that 35% of SMEs in Qatar are concerned about the rising cost of doing business (Mastercard 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_dcece3774e8c", "text": "ed with extreme caution.

While the Qatar Development Bank\u2019s (QDB) 2020 report on SMEs indicates a sector with strong growth and optimism, it also reveals underlying financial realities that shape HR decisions (QDB 2020b). For many SMEs, the focus remains on immediate operational costs rather than long-term strategic investments in human capital. For an SME owner, every hiring decision is critical and carries significant weight. The primary concern is often finding an individual with the precise skills and experience to be immediately productive and \u201chit the ground running.\u201d An experienced expatriate, often available at a lower salary expectation for certain roles and with a proven track record, may seem like the most rational business choice (Fernandez and Ali 2015). Hiring a fresh Qatari graduate, while fulfilling a national mandate, can entail significant opportunity costs: \u2022 Higher Salary Expectations: Qatari nationals often have higher salary expectations, driven by competitive public-sector wages, creating an immediate financial strain.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 29, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5f900f12b9fd", "text": "significant opportunity costs: \u2022 Higher Salary Expectations: Qatari nationals often have higher salary expectations, driven by competitive public-sector wages, creating an immediate financial strain. The dual labor market, where nationals are concentrated in high-paying public sector jobs, institutionalizes this wage gap (Thiollet 2023). \u2022 Training Investment: The SME must invest time and money in training the new hire, with no guarantee of retention in a competitive market. This diverts scarce resources from other critical business functions. Data from QDB\u2019s 2020 report shows that while 65% of SMEs provide some form of training, a significant portion (41%) oier only basic on-the- job training. Furthermore, the share of SMEs oiering no training at all increased from 17% in 2016 to 35% in 2020, suggesting that under pressure, training budgets are often the first to be cut (QDB 2020b). \u2022 Productivity Lag: There is an initial period of lower productivity as the new employee learns the ropes, which a small team feels more acutely than a large one. These factors represent a direct hit to an SME\u2019s tight budget. A study of Qatari SMEs found that \u201caccess to capital\u201d and \u201ccollateral requirements\u201d were among the biggest challenges identified by entrepreneurs, making them cautious about any non-essential expenditure (Fernandez and Ali 2015).

One of the primary constraints on SME growth in Qatar is the diiiculty in recruiting a skilled workforce, compounded by a broader lack of know- how and entrepreneurial capability (Fernandez and Ali 2015). This situation is further exacerbated by a structural misalignment between the outputs of the national education system and the specific skills demanded by the labor market (Badran 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c0fc7cb33861", "text": "Ali 2015). This situation is further exacerbated by a structural misalignment between the outputs of the national education system and the specific skills demanded by the labor market (Badran 2024). Most SMEs do not employ stai trained in: \u2022 Designing structured training or development programs \u2022 Creating formal mentorship schemes \u2022 Developing performance management or succession planning systems \u2022 Utilizing modern recruitment methods such as competency-based interviewing \u2022 Building institutional relationships with universities for talent pipelines These limitations result in a highly informal approach to talent development. Training for Qatari employees typically takes the form of on-the-job instruction, dependent on the willingness of the owner or a senior colleague to serve as an informal mentor. While this may suiice for basic Page 12 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 30th, 2025 operational tasks, the absence of structure limits skill acquisition, under-utilizes employee potential, and reduces retention.

Between 2016 and 2020, the proportion of micro-enterprises with dedicated HR stai rose from 6% to 41%, while small enterprises saw an increase from 34% to 68% (QDB 2020b). This indicates a growing awareness of the strategic value of human resource management, even though expertise gaps remain. 3.4 Compliance as a Regulatory Hurdle vs. a Strategic Goal Given limited resources and insuiicient HR capacity, most SMEs approach Qatarization reactively. It is primarily seen as a regulatory requirement rather than a lever for workforce transformation. Their main objective is often to meet the quota threshold in order to avoid penalties, such as delayed visa approvals for expatriate stai. These types of delays can severely disrupt business operations (Mammadov 2011). This dynamic results in a widespread \u201cbox-ticking\u201d mentality. Firms focus on demonstrating technical compliance rather than implementing meaningful localization strategies. A survey of Qatari SME entrepreneurs found that 60% were either unaware of or not utilizing available government support programs designed to ease nationalization burdens (Fernandez and Ali 2015).

As a result, Qatarization often leads to suboptimal outcomes. One example is assigning Qatari hires to token roles with limited responsibility or development potential, which contributes to dissatisfaction and attrition on both sides. This behavior, while understandable from a business survival perspective, contradicts the long- term goals of national workforce development. It also reflects a broader structural issue in policy implementation. As noted by Thiollet (2023), reforms that aim to formalize and nationalize the labor market can paradoxically increase informality among resource-constrained firms. Faced with higher recruitment costs and reduced flexibility, some SMEs resort to workarounds, including \u201cfree visas\u201d or \u201cghost employment.\u201d In such cases, Qataris are placed on the payroll solely to meet compliance quotas, without being actively engaged in the company\u2019s operations. Such outcomes undermine the state\u2019s strategic intent. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry\u2019s (MOCI) 2024\u20132030 strategy frames Qatarization not simply as a quota policy but as a tool to increase national workforce participation and capabilities in the private sector (MOCI 2025).

These initiatives address longstanding regional concerns about the lack of high-quality business support services for SMEs in the GCC (Hertog 2007). The Ministry of Labour (MoL) has also expanded its direct role in workforce preparation and coordination. The first phase of its unified national employment platform was launched to simplify and centralize processes for connecting Qatari job seekers with private sector employers (MoL 2024b). The Cabinet further reinforced this direction by announcing a suite of economic measures aimed at revitalizing private sector participation in national workforce development (GCC Business Watch 2024). This whole-of-government approach is also reflected in the MoL\u2019s inter-agency coordination, particularly with the Civil Service and Government Development Bureau, to develop national workforce skills and improve labor market alignment (MoL 2025).

Together, these measures represent an important shift: from fragmented interventions to more structured, inclusive, and SME-responsive nationalization tools. 4.2 The Potential of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) represent a promising mechanism to bridge the capacity divide between large corporations and SMEs in achieving Qatarization goals. These partnerships can create synergistic relationships by leveraging the resources, expertise, and networks of large firms, while enabling SMEs to scale their capabilities and contribute meaningfully to national workforce development.

The Qatar Development Bank\u2019s (QDB) 2020 report on PPPs underscores this point, highlighting the need for targeted initiatives that ensure SME participation in large- scale projects (QDB 2020a). Without intentional design, SMEs may be excluded from these opportunities due to administrative complexity, high compliance thresholds, or a lack of established relationships with government buyers and tier-one contractors. To overcome these barriers, PPPs must be structured to facilitate SME inclusion not only as subcontractors, but also as active contributors to innovation and employment. The following two strategic pathways can help achieve this. Page 16 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 30th, 2025 4.2.1 Corporate Mentorship and Supply Chain Integration Large corporations operating in Qatar, particularly those with privileged access to state-linked projects, can be incentivized to support SMEs within their supply chains. This support can take the form of structured mentorship arrangements and procurement policies that reward national workforce development. Key strategies include: \u2022 \u201cAdopting\u201d an SME: A large enterprise can establish a formal partnership with a smaller supplier, providing mentorship, knowledge transfer, and operational guidance. This approach enables SMEs to build technical capacity, improve compliance readiness, and align with best practices in workforce development.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 44, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_392f228035a4", "text": "mentorship, knowledge transfer, and operational guidance. This approach enables SMEs to build technical capacity, improve compliance readiness, and align with best practices in workforce development. The International Labour Organization (ILO) notes that such upstream-downstream linkages are critical for fostering inclusive value chains and improving SME competitiveness (ILO. Enterprises Department. 2017). In the Gulf region, this approach helps address the long-standing issue of the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d which refers to the structural gap between a dominant state-linked corporate sector and a fragmented, under-resourced SME base (Hertog 2007). \u2022 Including Qatarization in Procurement Criteria: Procurement policies can be designed to encourage, or even require, SMEs to develop robust Qatarization plans. By integrating national workforce metrics into tender evaluations, large corporations can help extend localization eiorts throughout their supply chains. Qatar\u2019s evolving PPP framework already provides a policy platform for this integration. For example, some mechanisms oier preferential scoring systems that reward consortiums demonstrating strong SME engagement or employment of Qatari nationals (QDB 2020a). These initiatives shift the perception of Qatarization from a compliance burden to a shared strategic goal across the entire value chain, supporting both localization and SME development.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 45, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0ee8b59e73e3", "text": "QDB 2020a). These initiatives shift the perception of Qatarization from a compliance burden to a shared strategic goal across the entire value chain, supporting both localization and SME development. 4.2.2 Sector-Specific Training Consortia Another high-impact model is the creation of sector-specific training consortia, coordinated by industry associations with support from the government. This model allows firms within the same sector to pool resources in order to design and deliver targeted, cost-eiective training that would otherwise be inaccessible to most SMEs. \u2022 The OECD identifies training consortia as a European best practice. This model is particularly eiective in ensuring that training aligns with the real-world needs of employers (OECD 2021). \u2022 A notable international example is Ireland\u2019s Skillnets, a government-funded initiative that supports more than 60 sector-specific training networks. These networks enable SMEs to access subsidized, certified training that is often co-designed with industry stakeholders to reflect market demand (ILO. Enterprises Department. 2017). In Qatar, a similar model could be adapted to promote Qatarization in high-priority sectors such as: \u2022 Technology: Training in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI, aligned with Qatar\u2019s Digital Agenda 2030 (MCIT 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 46, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bd77ac85782f", "text": "odel could be adapted to promote Qatarization in high-priority sectors such as: \u2022 Technology: Training in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI, aligned with Qatar\u2019s Digital Agenda 2030 (MCIT 2024).

By institutionalizing collaborative training platforms, these consortia could improve training quality, reduce duplication, and support the sustained integration of Qatari nationals into the private sector. 4.3 Aligning Education with Private Sector Needs The success of Qatarization eiorts depends not only on policies and business incentives but also on a reformed education system that aligns more closely with labor market demands. In Qatar and across the broader GCC region, there is a well-documented gap between what students are taught and what employers, particularly in the private sector, actually require (Badran 2024; World Bank 2019). Many university graduates enter the workforce with limited practical experience or with skill sets that are mismatched to industry needs (Stasz et al. 2007; Hendy 2016).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ed8c16c7a5db", "text": "adran 2024; World Bank 2019). Many university graduates enter the workforce with limited practical experience or with skill sets that are mismatched to industry needs (Stasz et al. 2007; Hendy 2016). To close this gap, a multifaceted strategy is needed, one that bridges education and employment, especially in the SME sector where resource constraints make the hiring of underprepared graduates particularly risky. Key interventions include: \u2022 Curriculum Co-design: Universities and colleges must engage directly with employers, including SMEs and industry associations, to integrate practical and market-relevant skills into academic programs. This includes both technical competencies, such as proficiency in IT tools or financial software, and broader soft skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. Badran (2024) highlights the need for learning outcomes that reflect real-world expectations as a critical step in making education more responsive to labor market needs. \u2022 Internship and Co-op Programs: Embedding structured work-based learning into degree programs is essential for developing job-ready graduates. These initiatives provide students with practical experience and help employers assess talent before hiring.

UNESCO underscores that well-functioning Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) systems are central to workforce development. This includes not only technical training but also fostering strong partnerships between education providers and employers to ensure that internships and apprenticeships are meaningful and lead to viable career opportunities (UNESCO 2025). \u2022 Promoting Entrepreneurship: Instilling an entrepreneurial mindset among students is critical to diversifying the economy and expanding employment opportunities beyond the public sector. Education systems should embed entrepreneurship training and startup support at multiple levels, including secondary, vocational, and tertiary education. According to Aku-Sika and Gubik (2019), embedding entrepreneurship in curricula helps students view small business creation as a realistic and rewarding career path. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also stressed that fostering Page 18 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team June 30th, 2025 entrepreneurial mindsets is essential to unlocking the economic potential of youth in the Arab world and building more dynamic labor markets (Stepanyan et al. 2019).

Each of these reforms requires deep collaboration among stakeholders: educational institutions, employers, ministries, and industry bodies. Without such alignment, the challenge of skill mismatches will persist, limiting the impact of Qatarization initiatives and placing continued strain on SMEs that are expected to integrate new national talent without suiicient institutional support. 5. Conclusion The adaptation of HR and training budgets to Qatarization mandates highlights a clear and significant divide between the nation\u2019s large organizations and its SMEs. Large corporations, supported by substantial resources and long-term strategic planning, have successfully embedded Qatarization into their corporate strategies. They make significant investments in structured recruitment, comprehensive training, and employee development programs. Their approach is forward-looking and aligns closely with national objectives, viewing Qatarization not merely as a policy obligation but as a long-term investment in organizational resilience and their social license to operate. In contrast, SMEs, often constrained by limited financial and human resources, tend to treat Qatarization as a compliance requirement rather than a strategic initiative. For these firms, the policy introduces financial and administrative challenges that conflict with day-to-day operational priorities such as cost control and short-term growth.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-06-09", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 50, "total_chunks": 81, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q4_EN_2025-06-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-06-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b9225a8a555f", "text": "a strategic initiative.

This diierence is not a matter of commitment, but rather reflects a stark disparity in access to resources and institutional capabilities. This structural imbalance is well explained by the Resource-Based View, which describes how organizations with fewer resources are less able to transform strategic mandates into long-term value. If SMEs are not empowered to participate meaningfully, the broader goals of Qatarization, particularly those linked to the Human Development pillar of Qatar National Vision 2030, will remain only partially fulfilled. The sustainability of Qatar\u2019s national workforce strategy depends on comprehensive engagement across all business segments, including the often-overlooked SME sector. To bridge this divide, a multi-pronged policy response is essential.

Introduction 1.1 The Macroeconomic Imperative: Qatar National Vision 2030 and the Economics of Diversification The State of Qatar\u2019s economic trajectory is guided by the ambitious Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030), a strategic framework designed to navigate the nation away from the inherent volatilities and finite nature of a hydrocarbon-dependent economy (GSDP 2008). Launched in 2008, the vision is a direct policy response to the economic phenomenon known as the \u201cresource curse,\u201d or the paradox of plenty, where countries with an abundance of natural resources often experience slower economic growth, less democracy, and worse development outcomes (Badeeb, Lean, and Clark 2017). The \u201cresource curse\u201d concept itself is a well-established, though evolving, field of economic study (Kinnaman 2023). QNV 2030 aims to short-circuit this paradox by orchestrating a structural transformation towards a diversified, competitive, and, crucially, knowledge-based economic model (GCO n.d.; Sharq Law Firm 2025). This transition is critical for fossil fuel export-dependent economies facing the prospect of global decarbonization, which could lead to significant fiscal and economic transition costs (Jensen 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0cb635390288", "text": "is transition is critical for fossil fuel export-dependent economies facing the prospect of global decarbonization, which could lead to significant fiscal and economic transition costs (Jensen 2023). Central to this grand strategy is the Human Development Pillar, which posits that the nation\u2019s most sustainable and valuable long-term asset is its own citizenry (GSDP 2008). This pillar is not merely a social goal but a fundamental economic imperative (Sharq Law Firm 2025). In a world increasingly focused on the global energy transition and decarbonization, the long-term fiscal stability of the state can no longer be guaranteed by hydrocarbon revenues alone (Jensen 2023). Therefore, cultivating a skilled, productive, and motivated national workforce capable of driving growth in non-oil sectors, such as finance, logistics, technology, and tourism, is essential for ensuring long-term economic sovereignty and prosperity (Kularatne, Miyajima, and Muir 2024). Recent economic data underscores this reality; while Qatar\u2019s real GDP growth was a modest 2.6% in 2024, non-hydrocarbon activities expanded by a more robust 3.7%, driven by significant growth in education (+14.4%) and tourism-related services (+8.7%) (Bank Audi 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2cab672d5e9a", "text": "growth was a modest 2.6% in 2024, non-hydrocarbon activities expanded by a more robust 3.7%, driven by significant growth in education (+14.4%) and tourism-related services (+8.7%) (Bank Audi 2025).

This report argues that two of the most potent tools in this endeavor are a meticulously structured Performance Evaluation (PE) system and a well-funded, comprehensive Professional Development Plan (PDP).

In the context of Qatar, a workforce of highly skilled and loyal Qatari nationals constitutes a premier strategic asset that is Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, and Non-substitutable (the VRIN framework), as there is no long-term alternative for strategic success in the Qatari market (Barney 1991; Mahoney and Pandian 1992). Complementing the RBV, we draw on Human Capital Theory, pioneered by Gary Becker. This theory views education and training as investments that increase productivity. Extensive empirical research confirms that it is the quality of education, measured through the cognitive skills that constitute a nation\u2019s \u201cknowledge capital,\u201d that is the crucial driver of long-run economic growth, not merely the quantity of schooling (Hanushek and Woessmann 2021; Goczek, Witkowska, and Witkowski 2021).

Performance Evaluation as a Tool for Human Capital Development and Risk Mitigation 2.1 Beyond the Scorecard: Performance Evaluation as an Economic Instrument A strategically designed performance evaluation system moves far beyond a simple administrative scorecard to become a powerful economic instrument. Its primary function is to serve as a mechanism for risk management and incentive alignment, addressing several core economic problems. First, it directly confronts the problem of information asymmetry (Akerlof 1970). In the labor market, employers face adverse selection and moral hazard. A transparent PE system, based on clear metrics and regular feedback, reduces both problems by clarifying expectations and creating a rich dataset on performance over time (Sumi 2023). Second, the PE system is the primary vehicle for establishing organizational justice.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_246d7480de2b", "text": "educes both problems by clarifying expectations and creating a rich dataset on performance over time (Sumi 2023). Second, the PE system is the primary vehicle for establishing organizational justice. This concept is twofold: Distributive justice (fairness of outcomes) and Procedural justice (fairness of processes). Research overwhelmingly shows that procedural justice can be even more powerful in fostering employee loyalty and organizational citizenship behaviors (Abu-Tineh et al. 2023). For Qatari employees who may be wary of opaque decision-making, a PE system with clear standards and calibration provides a credible guarantee of fair treatment. Finally, we can analyze the PE system through the lens of Signalling Theory (Spence 1973). A sophisticated PE system acts as a powerful market signal. It signals to current and prospective Qatari employees that the organization is a meritocracy and is professionally managed. This signal is particularly potent in the Qatari context, enhancing the firm\u2019s employer brand and lowering the cost of talent acquisition (Saab n.d.). 2.2 Architecting a High-Impact Performance System: A Phased Approach In a labor market where the public sector has long been the benchmark for career stability and advancement, the private sector\u2019s evaluation systems face a higher burden of proof.

To build the necessary trust and overcome the powerful \u2018pull\u2019 of government employment, these systems must be demonstrably fair, transparent, and culturally attuned. Establishing a continuous two- way dialogue is the first step in proving the system\u2019s integrity and building a high-trust, positive workplace culture (Hamdan n.d.). This approach helps mitigate the perceived career risks associated with a performance-based culture (Bunglawala 2011). This process can be broken down into four distinct, yet interconnected, phases that address the core challenges of attracting, motivating, and retaining national talent in the competitive Qatari labor market. 2.2.1 Phase 1: Goal Setting and Cascading Objectives The foundational phase of any ekective performance system is ensuring that the goals of individual employees are directly aligned with the strategic objectives of the organization. This is a universal management challenge, but it becomes particularly critical in the unique context of Qatar\u2019s private sector. Here, a firm (the \u201cprincipal\u201d) makes a significant investment in hiring and developing a national employee (the \u201cagent\u201d). However, the agent always has the attractive Page 4 of 22 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 8th, 2025 alternative of a secure, high-paying public sector job.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0832d5ce138c", "text": "oyee (the \u201cagent\u201d). However, the agent always has the attractive Page 4 of 22 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 8th, 2025 alternative of a secure, high-paying public sector job. This creates a risk for the principal that the agent\u2019s long-term interests may not be fully aligned with the firm\u2019s goals, and the principal cannot perfectly monitor the agent\u2019s day-to-day ekort or long-term commitment. This fundamental conflict of interest and information asymmetry is known in economics as the principal-agent problem (Corgnet, G\u00f3mez-Mi\u00f1ambres, and Gonzalez 2016). Modern goal-setting frameworks, such as Management by Objectives (MBO) and its more agile evolution, Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), are designed specifically to solve this issue. The foundational concept of MBO focuses on creating agreed-upon objectives to improve performance (Abdallah and Elhoss 2019), while the globally adopted OKR system pairs inspirational goals with measurable, time-bound outcomes (Doerr 2018). Both frameworks move beyond traditional, static appraisals that simply look in the \u201crearview mirror\u201d at past performance (Giken 2021). Through a process of \u201ccascading,\u201d these systems create a transparent \u201cline of sight\u201d from the company\u2019s highest strategic aims down to an individual\u2019s daily work (Zimyo, 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e4667a392ba1", "text": "formance (Giken 2021).

This process makes it explicit how an employee\u2019s contributions directly advance the organization\u2019s mission, fostering the sense of purpose and growth that are essential for motivation and retention (Giken 2021). 2.2.2 Phase 2: Data Gathering and Multi-Source Feedback Once goals are defined, progress must be measured through a fair and comprehensive data- gathering process. Modern performance management has moved beyond relying on the single opinion of a direct manager. International best practice emphasizes gathering multi-source feedback to create a holistic view of an employee\u2019s performance. This includes: \u2022 Managerial Reviews: The traditional assessment of performance against set objectives (KPIs). \u2022 360-Degree Feedback: Confidential feedback from peers, direct reports, and even clients, used primarily for developmental purposes rather than evaluation (Abboud 2021). \u2022 Self-Assessments: Requiring employees to reflect on their own performance, which fosters ownership and identifies gaps in perception. However, in the Qatari context, the method of feedback delivery is as important as its content. While the system must be objective, its application must be culturally calibrated.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_964499f5770c", "text": "gaps in perception. However, in the Qatari context, the method of feedback delivery is as important as its content. While the system must be objective, its application must be culturally calibrated. Academic frameworks on cultural dikerences highlight that in societies characterized by high power distance and collectivism, such as Qatar, communication must be adapted to respect hierarchy and preserve group harmony (Khalil-Ur-Rehman and Mehmood 2024). This reinforces the principle that in high-context cultures, feedback is often delivered more indirectly to avoid causing a loss of \u201cface\u201d (Vorecol Editorial Team 2024). A blunt, Western-style feedback mechanism could therefore be counterproductive. Instead, an indirect and \u201cface-saving\u201d communication style is essential, ensuring that feedback is received as constructive rather than confrontational (Khalil-Ur-Rehman and Mehmood 2024). To further reduce subjectivity, many global firms use Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS). Instead of a vague rating like \u201c5/5 for teamwork,\u201d a BARS would provide a specific behavioral example, such as, \u201cProactively shares critical information with other teams and okers help without being asked\u201d (Entomo 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 13, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b4e889e1f145", "text": "ting like \u201c5/5 for teamwork,\u201d a BARS would provide a specific behavioral example, such as, \u201cProactively shares critical information with other teams and okers help without being asked\u201d (Entomo 2023). This multi-faceted and behavior-based approach builds crucial trust by demonstrating a commitment to objective assessment, mitigating the risk of Page 5 of 22 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 8th, 2025 perceived managerial bias and assuring employees that evaluations are robust and evidence- based. 2.2.3 Phase 3: Calibration and the Evaluation Dialogue This phase is where procedural justice is institutionalized, ensuring the data gathered is applied fairly and consistently across the organization. The core mechanism is the calibration session, a practice now widely adopted by high-performing organizations to improve rating quality (Speer, Tenbrink, and Schwendeman 2019). In these meetings, managers from across a department or division come together to discuss the ratings they have proposed for their team members. They must defend their assessments to their peers, providing evidence and specific examples. This process of public justification increases rater accountability and is particularly crucial in the Qatari context, where a high power-distance culture can lead to a reluctance to document potentially negative feedback in writing (Wilbur, Bacha, and Abdelaziz 2017).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 14, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2f29c42b1d3f", "text": "d is particularly crucial in the Qatari context, where a high power-distance culture can lead to a reluctance to document potentially negative feedback in writing (Wilbur, Bacha, and Abdelaziz 2017). The calibration session\u2019s primary purpose is to attenuate these individual supervisor biases and increase the accuracy of the final ratings (Grabner, K\u00fcnneke, and Moers 2020). This ensures that one manager\u2019s \u201chigh performer\u201d is held to the same standard as another\u2019s, preventing rating inflation and personal bias. Following calibration, the evaluation itself is delivered not as a verdict, but as part of an ongoing, coaching-focused dialogue. For this dialogue to be ekective, especially in a cross-cultural setting, its delivery must be culturally attuned; research on communication styles in the region shows that an indirect, \u201cface-saving\u201d approach is often preferred over a blunt, direct style to ensure feedback is received constructively (Khalil-Ur-Rehman and Mehmood 2024). This dialogue should not be confined to an annual review; indeed, regular feedback is often the missing piece in the employee retention puzzle (Franchell 2022). Frequent check-ins and continuous conversations about performance and development make employees feel valued and heard, directly strengthening their commitment to the firm (Henricks 2018).

It turns a potentially intimidating judgment into a constructive, forward-looking partnership, reinforcing the firm\u2019s commitment to their long-term career. 2.2.4 Phase 4: Linking Performance to Rewards and Development The final phase ensures the credibility of the entire system by creating a clear, transparent, and defensible link between performance outcomes and tangible rewards.

Indeed, it directly aligns with the stated aims of recent labour legislation, which, according to the Minister of Labour, is designed to support the private sector by providing \u201cqualified national competencies\u201d (QNA 2024). These investments, undertaken in partnership with national ekorts to create a skilled and productive workforce (GCO n.d.), create two distinct, yet complementary, types of human capital: \u2022 General Human Capital: Skills valuable to multiple firms (e.g., an MBA, a PMP certification). While an employee could take these skills elsewhere, okering such training acts as a powerful market signal of the firm\u2019s commitment to quality, helping it attract and retain top talent (Bradfield Learning and Development n.d.; Parsons 2025).

This is also a critical component of succession planning, ensuring deep, contextual knowledge is passed to the next generation of leaders (Thwin, Janarthanan, and Bhaumik 2023). The Return on Investment (ROI) for these programs can and should be modeled. The model must include direct costs (course fees), indirect costs (employee\u2019s salary while in training), and benefits such as quantified productivity gains, cost savings from ekiciency, and, critically, the avoided cost of turnover. Academic research confirms a direct, positive relationship between investment in training and development, employee retention, and overall organizational performance (Igbinoba et al. 2022). Systematic reviews further confirm that professional development is directly linked to reducing turnover (Shiri et al. 2023), a particularly salient fact in the highly competitive Qatari talent market where recruitment and onboarding represent major expenses (Pernenkil 2025).

Instead, a world-class PDP should Page 8 of 22 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 8th, 2025 be managed like a diversified portfolio of human capital investments, with a mix of interventions designed to meet the distinct needs of employees at dikerent career stages. This strategic, tiered approach is essential for actualizing the goals of Qatar\u2019s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which calls for a \u201cfuture-ready workforce\u201d (PSA 2024). It also aligns with the nation\u2019s broader labour reform agenda, being pursued with international partners like the ILO, to build a comprehensive, data-driven approach to labour market management (ILO 2024). As companies invest in their talent, they become active partners in the government\u2019s strategy of localizing skilled jobs in the private sector through platforms like \u201cKawader\u201d (MoL 2024b). \u2022 Stage 1: Foundational (New Qatari Graduates): Structured Graduate Development Programs (GDPs).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 22, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3e9722a29831", "text": "trategy of localizing skilled jobs in the private sector through platforms like \u201cKawader\u201d (MoL 2024b). \u2022 Stage 1: Foundational (New Qatari Graduates): Structured Graduate Development Programs (GDPs). This strategy aligns perfectly with the work of national institutions like Qatar University. The university has a formal, documented process to ensure that course- level learning outcomes are aligned with the broader institutional and national goals of QNV 2030, demonstrating a culture of evidence-based improvement aimed at maximizing graduate employability (Qatar University n.d.). By investing in GDPs, private firms are not just hiring graduates; they are integrating talent from a system explicitly designed to support the national vision (El Sayed 2025).

Research on knowledge transfer in the neighboring UAE emphasizes that organizational factors such as a culture of trust, supportive leadership, and appropriate rewards are critical for facilitating the sharing of expertise from senior to junior employees (Al Nuaimi and Jabeen 2020). This ensures the systematic transfer of valuable, firm-specific human capital to the next generation of Qatari leaders.

The Retention Equation: An Economic Analysis of Qatari Talent 4.1 The Opportunity Cost and the Multi-Attribute Utility Function of Qatari Nationals Every Qatari professional\u2019s career choice can be modeled as a rational economic decision aimed at maximizing their personal \u201cutility function\u201d (Sunardi, Umar, and Sahara 2022). This is not simply about maximizing salary; it is a multi-attribute utility function that can be expressed as: U = f(W, B, S, V, G, L, P), where the variables represent Wage, Benefits, Job Security, Career Velocity, Page 10 of 22 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 8th, 2025 Growth/Skill Acquisition, Work-Life Balance, and Psychic Income (the non-monetary or psychological benefits of a job, such as a sense of purpose, social status, and professional fulfillment), respectively. The public sector, underwritten by a generous social contract, provides an exceptionally high and stable baseline for several of these variables (Fatima and Elbanna 2025). The state\u2019s generous welfare schemes, social support, and family safety nets create a unique economic environment where the baseline for Job Security (S), Benefits (B), and Work-Life Balance (L) is set at a level that private firms cannot easily match (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ef31907e8be9", "text": "economic environment where the baseline for Job Security (S), Benefits (B), and Work-Life Balance (L) is set at a level that private firms cannot easily match (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023).

This is not merely a theoretical concern; studies within Qatar\u2019s own private sector, such as the food and beverage industry, confirm that high turnover directly damages the financial stability and capability of firms, with a lack of growth opportunities being a primary driver (Awolusi and Jayakody 2021). Although precise calculation is complex, economic models provide a clear framework for understanding this impact. The total cost is composed of both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include separation and replacement expenses such as administrative fees, recruitment advertising, and the time spent by management on exit and hiring interviews (O\u2019Connell and Kung 2007).

This figure accounts for critical, value-destructive factors including: \u2022 Lost Productivity: This includes the output lost during the vacancy period and the reduced productivity of the new hire during their \u201cramp-up\u201d period (O\u2019Connell and Kung 2007). \u2022 Loss of Firm-Specific Human Capital: The departing employee takes with them valuable, inimitable knowledge about the company\u2019s processes, clients, and informal networks-a direct loss of \u201cknow-how\u201d that impacts institutional memory (Duda and \u017d\u016frkov\u00e1 2013). \u2022 Negative Externalities on Team Performance: Turnover can disrupt team cohesion, lower the morale of remaining employees, and divert existing resources to train the new hire, reducing the overall productivity of the department (Crisp 2021).

A more advanced analytical approach is to calculate the Employee Lifetime Value (ELTV). This framework models the total net value an employee is expected to bring to the company over their entire employment.

Conclusion The adaptation of private sector HR strategies to the mandates of Qatarization reveals a critical intersection between national economic policy, the nation\u2019s unique social contract, and firm- level strategic management. The long-term success of Qatar\u2019s economic diversification, as envisioned in QNV 2030, is contingent not merely on regulatory compliance but on the genuine and strategic integration of Qatari talent into the fabric of the private sector. This requires private firms to move beyond a reactive, cost-minimization mindset and adopt a proactive, evidence- based, and investment-oriented approach to human capital. This analysis has framed performance evaluations and professional development plans not as perfunctory HR functions, but as core economic strategies.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-08", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 55, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q5_EN_2025-07-08_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-08", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_302aba7675b7", "text": "nd investment-oriented approach to human capital. This analysis has framed performance evaluations and professional development plans not as perfunctory HR functions, but as core economic strategies. They are the essential tools by which firms can solve the information asymmetry problem, align principal-agent incentives, and build the kind of firm-specific, inimitable human capital that drives a sustainable competitive advantage. By making career progression transparent and investing visibly in employee growth, private organizations can fundamentally alter the opportunity cost calculation for Qatari professionals, making the private sector a compelling and rational long-term career choice. Key Takeaways: 1. A Fundamental Economic Divide: A profound implementation gap exists between large, resource-rich organizations that approach Qatarization as a strategic investment in human capital and smaller enterprises that often treat it as a reactive compliance burden due to resource constraints. 2. The Power of Signaling: Structured performance evaluations and professional Page 13 of 22 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 8th, 2025 development plans act as powerful market signals.

Solving the Principal-Agent Problem: These HR practices are critical mechanisms for aligning the interests of Qatari employees (agents) with the long-term goals of the firm (principal). By linking individual growth to organizational success, they foster a culture of shared purpose and mutual investment. 4. Retention as a Rational Choice: Ekective PE and PDP systems change the economic equation for Qatari talent. By making future rewards (promotions, leadership roles) clear and attainable, they increase the discounted future value of remaining with the firm, making retention the utility-maximizing option. 5. Beyond Compliance to Competitive Advantage: The firms that will thrive under Qatarization are those that leverage its mandates to build a rare and valuable human capital asset. A highly skilled, motivated, and loyal national workforce is a VRIN resource that provides a decisive and sustainable competitive advantage in the Qatari market. 6.

An Aligned National Ecosystem is Essential: The long-term success of nationalization hinges on an aligned ecosystem. This requires strategic corporate investment in PE and PDPs, supported by enabling government labor policies (such as those advanced by the Ministry of Labour) and a responsive national education system that is formally and demonstrably aligned with the needs of the private sector and the goals of QNV 2030. 7. The Need for a National Data Infrastructure: This analysis was constrained by a notable lack of high-frequency, granular statistical data on Qatar\u2019s private sector labor market. From an economic perspective, this information gap hinders the ability of both policymakers and firms to make optimally ekicient decisions. The development of a Labour Market Information System (LMIS) represents a critical future investment. Such a system would function as a public good, providing real-time data on workforce dynamics, wage pressures, and skill gaps. This would enable true evidence-based policymaking and allow private firms to move from reactive compliance to data-driven strategic human capital management.

This dynamic has resulted in the overwhelming dominance of the public sector as the employer of choice, creating a persistent skills mismatch with the private sector. This report begins by analyzing these foundational issues to provide a comprehensive context for the policy imperatives, such as Qatarization, that aim to rebalance the labor market. 1.1 Introduction: The Challenge of a Rentier Economy The State of Qatar, like other nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), faces a unique and pressing economic challenge: how to transition from a rentier economy, heavily reliant on hydrocarbon wealth, to a diversified, sustainable, and knowledge-based model. This transition is made more urgent by a significant \u201cyouth bulge,\u201d with an unprecedented number of young, educated nationals entering the labor market and creating immense demographic pressure (Singh, Jones, and Hall 2012). Despite credible and ambitious government-led initiatives to diversify the economy and promote private enterprise, the labor market remains largely characterized by a structural dichotomy: a public sector that is the overwhelmingly preferred employer for its citizens, and a large private sector that is primarily staged by expatriate labor (Bunglawala 2011). This dynamic was underscored in April 2023, when Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister articulated the diversification of national employment away from the public sector as a key national priority (Beschel Jr. and Yousef 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c8ed177d8a97", "text": "was underscored in April 2023, when Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister articulated the diversification of national employment away from the public sector as a key national priority (Beschel Jr. and Yousef 2023). This report analyzes the drivers behind this enduring preference for public sector employment, exploring the complex interplay of economic incentives, socio-cultural norms, and national policies. To fully understand the challenges and opportunities in Qatar, it is essential to first place them within the global context of public-private employment dynamics before examining the specific local manifestations. 1.2 The Public Sector Wage Premium: A Global and Theoretical Framework Globally, the relationship between public and private sector compensation is a central topic in labor economics. The concept of a public wage premium, where public sector employees earn more than their private sector counterparts with comparable skills and characteristics, has been the subject of extensive research. The public sector is a major employer, accounting for 37% of formal employment worldwide (World Bank 2021b). In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, its role is even more pronounced, making up 23% of total employment, compared to the global average of 16% (World Bank 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_464e1e978305", "text": "de (World Bank 2021b). In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, its role is even more pronounced, making up 23% of total employment, compared to the global average of 16% (World Bank 2023). Page 2 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 A landmark meta-analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) covering 86 countries found that, on average, a public wage premium of approximately 10 percent exists globally. This premium, however, is not uniform. It tends to be lower in advanced economies (around 5.4%) and significantly higher in emerging markets (11.7%) and developing countries (12.8%) (Abdallah, Coady, and Jirasavetakul 2023). Analysis from the World Bank across 111 countries confirms this trend, finding that public sector workers on average earn 19 percent higher basic wages than observably similar private sector workers (World Bank 2021b). This wage digerential is driven by several factors. Theoretically, public wages can be influenced by political considerations rather than purely profit-driven motives. Furthermore, public sector roles often come with significant non-pecuniary benefits, such as greater job security, generous pension schemes, and more predictable working hours, which are collectively known as \u201ccompensating digerentials\u201d (Abdallah, Coady, and Jirasavetakul 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_991f6a3fb158", "text": "its, such as greater job security, generous pension schemes, and more predictable working hours, which are collectively known as \u201ccompensating digerentials\u201d (Abdallah, Coady, and Jirasavetakul 2023). When benefits like pensions are included, the public sector wage premium can increase significantly; for instance, in some countries, including these benefits raised the premium from 15 percent to as high as 42 percent (World Bank 2021b). Cross-country analyses by institutions like the IMF reveal two critical dimensions to this premium (Abdallah, Coady, and Jirasavetakul 2023): \u2022 By Gender: The wage premium is often higher for women than for men, suggesting that public sector employment can sometimes serve to counteract gender pay discrimination prevalent in the private sector. For example, global data shows that women\u2019s average wages are 88 percent of male wages in the public sector, compared to just 74 percent in the private sector, indicating a smaller gender pay gap in government roles (World Bank 2021b). \u2022 By Skill Level: The premium is significantly higher for low-skilled workers, while the gap for high-skilled workers is much smaller, or sometimes even negative. Supporting data illustrates this, showing that public sector workers with only a primary education have a wage premium of 9 percent, while those with tertiary education have a premium of just 2 percent (World Bank 2021b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9e3e77b23c09", "text": "rates this, showing that public sector workers with only a primary education have a wage premium of 9 percent, while those with tertiary education have a premium of just 2 percent (World Bank 2021b). This trend is particularly evident in the MENA region, where senior public sector ogicials face an average wage penalty of 14% compared to their formal private sector counterparts, making it challenging for governments to attract and retain top talent (World Bank 2023; World Bank 2021b). This global framework provides the essential lens through which to analyze the specific and pronounced nature of these dynamics within Qatar. 1.3 Public Sector Dominance in Qatar: A Case of Premium and Preference The global phenomenon of a public wage premium finds a particularly strong expression in Qatar. More than 90% of employed Qatari nationals work in the public sector, which functions not just as an employer but as the primary vehicle for distributing the nation\u2019s hydrocarbon wealth (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024). Ogicial statistics from 2023 confirm this, showing that 82% of the total Qatari labor force is employed in the public sector, with the private sector employing less than 10% of Qatari nationals (Qatar Open Data Portal n.d.). This dominance is Page 3 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 underpinned by a powerful set of incentives that align perfectly with the theoretical drivers identified globally.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8b01b1ba4809", "text": "e is Page 3 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 underpinned by a powerful set of incentives that align perfectly with the theoretical drivers identified globally. \u2022 Financial and Non-Financial Benefits: The financial rewards of a government job in Qatar are substantial. In 2008, public sector salaries were, on average, 2.3 times higher than they had been just three years prior, a rate of increase that far outpaced the private sector (Rahahleh 2012). This is supplemented by a comprehensive benefits package that includes housing allowances, children\u2019s education support, healthcare, significant annual bonuses, and car loans (Bunglawala 2011). Perhaps most importantly, public jobs are perceived to oger unparalleled job security, a stark contrast to the performance- based, termination-prone nature often associated with private firms (Bunglawala 2011). \u2022 Socio-Cultural Factors: Beyond financial incentives, cultural norms solidify the public sector\u2019s appeal. Government employment is seen as prestigious, socially desirable, and compatible with family life, particularly for women, who benefit from family-friendly policies and predictable schedules (Barbar, Naguib, and AbuHilal 2024). This is strongly supported by recent data from the National Planning Council, which shows that a commanding 81.8% of employed Qatari women work in government departments and state-owned corporations (NPC 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2661742810de", "text": "ongly supported by recent data from the National Planning Council, which shows that a commanding 81.8% of employed Qatari women work in government departments and state-owned corporations (NPC 2025). This has led to an entrenched cultural preference for public administration roles and a corresponding aversion to vocational or \u201cblue-collar\u201d jobs, which are often viewed as belonging to the expatriate workforce (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). 1.4 The Private Sector Dilemma and the Skills Mismatch While the private sector ogers dynamism and merit-based advancement, it struggles to compete for Qatari talent. A key barrier is a persistent misalignment between the national education system\u2019s output and the private sector\u2019s needs (Weerakkody et al. 2015). Many Qatari graduates report feeling ill-equipped for a private sector environment, citing a lack of practical experience, internships, and critical soft skills training in their educational pathways (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). This reveals a critical paradox in the Qatari labor market. On paper, the workforce is highly qualified, with 60% of Qataris classified as \u201chighly skilled\u201d in senior, professional, or technical roles, compared to just 26% of non-Qataris (Qatar Open Data Portal n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9a36c16fe30a", "text": ", the workforce is highly qualified, with 60% of Qataris classified as \u201chighly skilled\u201d in senior, professional, or technical roles, compared to just 26% of non-Qataris (Qatar Open Data Portal n.d.). However, this apparent advantage is challenged by an underlying skills gap, which is empirically supported by Qatar\u2019s performance in standardized tests like PISA, where it lags behind OECD medians in key areas like STEM (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024). 1.5 Policy Imperatives: Qatarization and the Path Forward In response to these structural imbalances, the state has launched the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030), a foundational strategy to transition towards a diversified, knowledge-based economy (GSDP 2008). A core component of this is \u201dQatarization,\u201d a national policy to increase the employment of citizens in all sectors, especially the private sector (Sayre, Benmansour, and Constant 2015). While the policy\u2019s goals are clear, setting targets for national employment in key industries, its implementation has been challenging. Recent legislative egorts, however, show a renewed push.

Stability vs. Dynamism: Public vs Private Employment in Qatar The overwhelming preference for public sector employment among Qatari nationals is a cornerstone of the nation\u2019s labor market, shaped by a powerful combination of job security, substantial financial incentives, and deep-seated socio-cultural norms. While the private sector ogers dynamism and potential for merit-based advancement, it struggles to compete with the stability and holistic benefits provided by the state (Singh, Jones, and Hall 2012). This dynamic creates a structural dichotomy where over 90% of employed Qatari nationals work in the public sector, which functions not just as an employer but as the primary vehicle for distributing the nation\u2019s hydrocarbon wealth (Kularatne, Miyajima, and Muir 2024; Arugay 2021). 2.1 Job Security and Social Protection Public sector roles in Qatar are widely understood to oger unparalleled job security, a key driver of their appeal. This stability is anchored in strong employment protections, the prospect of lifelong tenure, and defined benefits through established pension schemes under the General Retirement and Social Insurance Authority (Naguib and Aref 2023). The public sector is governed by comprehensive regulations, such as the Civil Human Resource Law No.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a0b653ec2912", "text": "ension schemes under the General Retirement and Social Insurance Authority (Naguib and Aref 2023).

This environment significantly lowers the perceived risk of layogs, a crucial non-financial incentive for the national workforce. In stark contrast, the private sector is characterized by performance-based, term-limited contracts, making employment feel more precarious. Many nationals report a fear of dismissal or turnover in private firms, which diminishes the appeal of these roles regardless of pay (Naguib and Aref 2023). This is particularly true for the expatriate workforce that dominates the private sector. The Kafala (sponsorship) system, although reformed, has historically restricted the ability of expatriates to switch jobs, tying them to their initial employer and fostering a sense of insecurity (Irfan et al. 2024). This perception of the private sector as termination-prone stands in sharp opposition to the security ogered by the state, further cementing the public sector as the employer of choice (Yousef and Kabbani 2012).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 13, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d15d87a7b873", "text": "ion of the private sector as termination-prone stands in sharp opposition to the security ogered by the state, further cementing the public sector as the employer of choice (Yousef and Kabbani 2012).

In a significant policy evolution aimed at addressing this disparity, Qatar introduced the Social Insurance Law No. (1) of 2022.

Historically, the state has used its hydrocarbon revenues to ensure high public sector wages. A landmark move came in 2011 with the Emiri Decree No. 50, which mandated a 60% increase in basic salaries, social allowances, and pensions for civil service employees and a 120% increase for military personnel, a decision that significantly widened the Page 6 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 compensation gap with the private sector (Aguinaldo 2016; Mohaddes, Nugent, and Selim 2018; Singh, Jones, and Hall 2012).

This created a significant wage premium. A 2012 study confirmed that from 2005 to 2008, public sector salaries rose by an average of 2.3 times, a rate of increase that far outpaced the 1.7 times growth in private-sector salaries over the same period (Rahahleh 2012). Consequently, the public sector wage bill represents a significant portion of the national GDP, at around 10% (Singh, Jones, and Hall 2012). According to a World Bank report, this use of the wage bill as an instrument of the social contract is a central feature of the GCC development model (World Bank 2021a), though its scale also raises concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability, especially given the demographic pressures of a growing youth bulge. While high-skill positions in some private industries may oger competitive base salaries, they often lack the extensive benefits packages that are standard in public roles (Naguib and Aref 2023). Government employment typically includes a comprehensive suite of benefits such as housing and transport allowances, children\u2019s education support, healthcare, and significant annual bonuses (Arugay 2021). For instance, a 2014 Aon Hewitt survey found that Qatar provided the highest housing allowances for senior management in the GCC, underscoring the comprehensive nature of public sector compensation (Aon 2014).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3ac787bee201", "text": "ce, a 2014 Aon Hewitt survey found that Qatar provided the highest housing allowances for senior management in the GCC, underscoring the comprehensive nature of public sector compensation (Aon 2014). When these benefits are fully accounted for, the total compensation package in public employment often outweighs that of equivalent private-sector roles. This has led to a situation where Gulf youth, when polled, overwhelmingly favor the public sector due to its superior wage and benefit packages (Yousef and Kabbani 2012). This preference remains strong, with a 2017 Arab Youth Survey finding that 70% of young people across the GCC would prefer a public sector job, citing better salaries and benefits as the primary motivation (Qatar Tribune 2016). Recent research indicates that a majority of unemployed Qataris cite lower wages as the principal reason for avoiding private sector work (Beschel Jr. and Yousef 2023).

These factors create a complex social landscape that the private sector finds digicult to navigate. 2.3.1 The Graduate Skills Gap A significant challenge in bridging the public-private divide is the persistent skills mismatch between the national education system\u2019s output and the private sector\u2019s needs. This creates a critical paradox: while nearly 60% of the Qatari labor force holds positions requiring a high level of expertise in professional or technical roles, many graduates report feeling ill-equipped for the private sector, citing a lack of practical experience, internships, and critical soft skills training in their educational pathways (Alkhayareen 2023; Jannat 2025; Said and Alhares 2021; Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d50bab03cf54", "text": "ck of practical experience, internships, and critical soft skills training in their educational pathways (Alkhayareen 2023; Jannat 2025; Said and Alhares 2021; Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). This issue is not unique to Qatar; across the Arab region, there is often a surplus of university graduates whose qualifications do not align with market-oriented technical demands (ILO 2008). Research confirms this mismatch is particularly acute in key growth sectors. A 2021 study on Qatar\u2019s finance and banking industry found a clear gap between TVET curricula and employer needs. Employers in the sector overwhelmingly prioritized social and personal skills, such as leadership, communication, and cultural awareness, while TVET program leaders placed a higher emphasis on technical skills. This illustrates a fundamental disconnect in priorities (Said and Alhares 2021). Another case study of business students in Qatar reinforced this, identifying a specific deficiency in 21st-century skills deemed critical by employers (Alshare and Sewailem Page 8 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 2018). Adding to this complexity, studies across the GCC have found that private sector employees report greater satisfaction with growth and learning opportunities compared to their public sector counterparts, highlighting a regional disconnect between the perceived and actual opportunities for development (Singh, Jones, and Hall 2012).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0ac5a7955109", "text": "d learning opportunities compared to their public sector counterparts, highlighting a regional disconnect between the perceived and actual opportunities for development (Singh, Jones, and Hall 2012). The need for better job-education matching and a focus on developing a productive, rather than simply credentialed, workforce is therefore a critical component in making private sector careers a viable option (Elbanna and Fatima 2022). The Qatari government is actively working to close this gap through structured interventions. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) has expanded its Government Scholarship Plan for the 2024-2025 academic year, which directly links educational paths to labor market needs by ogering new specializations and privileges for students in both the public and private sectors (MOEHE 2024a). To create a more direct link between education and employment, the MOEHE also organizes events where scholarship students can conduct interviews directly with potential employers from various sectors, facilitating a smoother transition from university to the workplace (MOEHE 2024c). Furthermore, programs like \u201cTamheen\u201d and \u201cTamkeen\u201d are designed to address specific skill shortages by training university graduates and administrators to become qualified teachers, thereby directly tackling workforce needs in the crucial education sector (MOEHE 2024b; MOEHE, 2024d).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 22, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_233106f7aafd", "text": "kill shortages by training university graduates and administrators to become qualified teachers, thereby directly tackling workforce needs in the crucial education sector (MOEHE 2024b; MOEHE, 2024d).

This cultural preference is linked to what some have termed a \u201d\u2018mudir\u2019 or manager mentality,\u201d where the only culturally acceptable jobs are those that provide respect, status, and authority (Elbanna and Fatima 2022). This results in an entrenched preference for public administration roles and a corresponding aversion to vocational or \u201cblue-collar\u201d jobs, which are often viewed as belonging to the expatriate workforce (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023).. This structure is supported by a welfare state where extensive benefits create a culture of dependency on state provisions, reducing the incentive for citizens to seek employment outside the public sector (Elbanna and Fatima 2022; Almalek 2025). The perception of public sector work as a right and a reward, a core tenet of the social contract, shapes career aspirations from a young age (WEF 2014). The state\u02bcs own focus on achieving \u201dgovernment excellence\u201d further enhances the appeal and reputation of a public sector career (Kabbani 2025). Recognizing that this dynamic can hinder private sector growth, the government is increasingly turning to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) as a key policy to stimulate private sector egiciency and job creation (PwC 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bce47bd33a99", "text": "namic can hinder private sector growth, the government is increasingly turning to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) as a key policy to stimulate private sector egiciency and job creation (PwC 2025). Nevertheless, the state\u2019s massive and highly visible investment in world-class educational and health infrastructure continues to solidify its image as the primary and most powerful architect of the nation\u2019s development, reinforcing the prestige of public service (Ashghal n.d.). 2.3.3 Female Employment and Work-Life Balance The preference for public sector employment is especially pronounced among Qatari women, creating a unique set of dynamics that both enable and constrain their careers. An overwhelming 81.8% of the employed national female workforce is concentrated in government departments and state-owned corporations (Naguib and Aref 2023), a disparity visualized in Figure 2. This starkly contrasts with the overall labor force participation rate, where men are at 96% and women at just 58%, illustrating a significant gender gap in economic activity (Mathews 2024). This concentration is driven by the perception that public sector roles oger a more suitable and secure environment, providing job security, stability, shorter working hours, generous retirement packages, and a work culture aligned with communal values (Elbanna and Fatima 2022; Naguib and Madeeha 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3a14a6f0f9eb", "text": "nvironment, providing job security, stability, shorter working hours, generous retirement packages, and a work culture aligned with communal values (Elbanna and Fatima 2022; Naguib and Madeeha 2023).

Cultural norms and patriarchal values are powerful forces shaping these employment patterns. The concept of the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d is highly relevant, as studies confirm that even with high educational attainment, women\u2019s visibility in leadership positions remains low (Jannat 2025). Research identifies societal customs and disapproval from husbands as primary barriers to women\u2019s career advancement, with one study showing these factors were cited by 23.7% and 22.9% of respondents, respectively (Jannat 2025). A critical factor is the preference for gender- segregated work environments; a remarkable 76% of female respondents in one survey identified the mixed-gender environment as the main reason they chose not to work in the private sector (Al-Boinin 2022). These deeply embedded cultural expectations create what is termed a \u201ccontemporary Qatari patriarchy,\u201d where women are encouraged to seek employment but within a preserved, male-dominated structure (Jannat 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_06e4f0426d03", "text": "embedded cultural expectations create what is termed a \u201ccontemporary Qatari patriarchy,\u201d where women are encouraged to seek employment but within a preserved, male-dominated structure (Jannat 2025). The state\u2019s policies, while designed to be supportive, often reinforce this public-private divide. The extensive family welfare system in Qatar, which provides housing, healthcare, and education benefits, is closely linked to employment and public sector roles, making government work the most secure and logical choice for families (Almalek 2025). The state has actively enhanced this appeal through targeted legislation. In a significant recent move, the Civil Service and Government Development Bureau (CGB) implemented a system in 2023 that allows Qatari mothers in government agencies to opt for reduced, more flexible working hours to better balance family and professional duties (QNA 2023). The Ministry of Labour has likewise agirmed its commitment to policies that empower women and increase their participation in the workforce (MoL 2025). While these initiatives are crucial for supporting women, they also have the egect of further cementing the public sector as the primary and most attractive employer, making the challenge of diversifying the national workforce all the more complex.

It explores how cultural imperatives have been translated into legislative action, analyzes the impact of these policies, and identifies the remaining gaps between policy and practice. 3.1 The Cultural Imperative for Work-Life Balance In Qatari society, the family is the central and most basic unit, and its preservation and well-being are of paramount importance (Almalek 2025; Naguib and Aref 2023). This cultural framework, deeply rooted in a collectivist society where group interests are prioritized over individual concerns, places a particular emphasis on the domestic and caregiving roles of women (Al- Boinin 2022; Al Dulaimi and Sailan 2011). This creates a societal expectation that professional life must be harmonized with family responsibilities, a dynamic that is a central feature of the \u201cpatriarchal bargain\u201d in the region, where women navigate these norms to gain agency (Jannat 2025). The structure of society reinforces a gendered division of labor where men are primarily seen as breadwinners and women as caregivers, a view that directly influences employment choices (Al-Ghanim, Gardner, and Lari 2023). Consequently, Qatari women, even when highly educated and ambitious, consistently prioritize family and child-rearing when making career choices (Jannat 2025; Naguib and Aref 2023). This reality is reflected in multiple studies.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 31, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1e7be0ae1698", "text": "ven when highly educated and ambitious, consistently prioritize family and child-rearing when making career choices (Jannat 2025; Naguib and Aref 2023). This reality is reflected in multiple studies. A survey of young Qatari graduates found that female students, despite diverse professional goals, agreed that family and child-rearing are their top priority after marriage (James-Hawkins, Qutteina, and Yount 2017). Another study found that 44.6% of women who forwent employment cited being a housewife as the reason (Al-Boinin 2022), and analysis of Labor Force Sample Surveys from 2018 to 2023 reveals that housewives consistently represent a substantial share of the total economically inactive Qatari female population. This proportion has ranged from 41.2% to 44.5%, with the most recent figure recorded at 42.8% in 2023 (NPC 2024). This cultural expectation creates a clear and persistent demand for work arrangements that oger predictability, security, and flexibility, qualities that are strongly associated with the public sector (Barbar, Naguib, and AbuHilal 2024; DIFI 2019). The public sector is perceived as ogering a manageable workload, shorter hours, and greater job security as part of an unspoken \u201csocial contract\u201d (Elsharnouby et al. 2023).

Source: National Planning Council. 3.2 The Legislative Response: Qatar\u2019s Evolving Family-Friendly Framework In response to these deep-seated sociocultural needs, Qatar has progressively developed a legislative framework aimed at supporting working families. The State\u2019s commitment to gender equality in the workforce began to be formally established with the Civil Service Act (Law No. 1 of 2001) and the Retirement and Pensions Law (Law No. 24 of 2002), which provided retirement benefits for women (Jannat, 2025). The current framework is anchored by the Civil Human Resource Law No. (15) of 2016, which stands as a key pillar of this egort, codifying a range of family-friendly benefits for the public sector (\u201cLaw No. 15 of 2016 Promulgating the Civil Service Human Resources Law\u201d 2016; Barbar, Naguib, and AbuHilal 2024). Key provisions within this framework include generous leave policies.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_36ebb465beb4", "text": "public sector (\u201cLaw No. 15 of 2016 Promulgating the Civil Service Human Resources Law\u201d 2016; Barbar, Naguib, and AbuHilal 2024). Key provisions within this framework include generous leave policies. The law provides for 60 days of paid maternity leave, which extends to 90 days for mothers of twins, and a two-hour daily breastfeeding break for two years post-maternity leave. Notably, Qatari mothers of children with disabilities can be granted a fully paid leave of up to five years to care for their child (Barbar, Naguib, and AbuHilal 2024). These policies were further enhanced by Cabinet Decree No. 13 of 2021, which established the regulations and conditions for part-time work in government agencies. In September 2024, the government began implementing this decree, introducing a new part-time system that allows employees to work 17.5 hours per week, with priority given to female employees, especially those with children. The Chairman of the Civil Service Bureau, Abdulaziz bin Nasser Al-Khalifa, agirmed that this system is a pivotal step towards enhancing the balance between employees\u2019 professional and personal lives, boosting productivity, and increasing job satisfaction (Qawl Fassel 2024).

These direct employment policies are underpinned by broader social security reforms, most notably the Social Insurance Law No. (1) of 2022. This landmark legislation, which came into egect on January 3, 2023, is designed to create a more uniform and robust safety net for all Qatari nationals by applying to those working in both the public and private sectors (Higham and Thomas 2023). The law aims to bridge the benefits gap between the sectors and encourage citizens to remain in the workforce for longer. It mandates a total monthly contribution of 21% of an employee\u2019s salary (capped at QAR 100,000 per month), with 14% paid by the employer and 7% by the employee.

Forced to shift to remote work, many female employees experienced firsthand the benefits of a more flexible schedule that allowed them to better integrate their professional and domestic responsibilities (Al-Boinin 2022). Public discourse during this period, particularly on social media platforms, revealed a strong latent demand for remote work among Qatari women. Many saw it as a viable solution to the long- standing work-family dilemma, ogering a way to pursue a career without compromising their role in the family. A poll conducted by a lawyer on Twitter in June 2020 found that 76.8% of 1,181 respondents supported continuing remote work for married women post-pandemic (Al-Boinin 2022). For many, telework addressed key cultural barriers, such as concerns over mixed-gender workplaces and the logistical challenges of childcare. This experience has firmly placed remote and flexible working arrangements on the policy agenda as a promising and culturally resonant long-term solution to boost female labor force participation (Al-Boinin 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 38, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b8849b12963d", "text": "e has firmly placed remote and flexible working arrangements on the policy agenda as a promising and culturally resonant long-term solution to boost female labor force participation (Al-Boinin 2022). 3.4 Remaining Gaps Between Policy and Practice Despite these significant legislative advancements, a gap often remains between policy intent and lived reality. Many working women, including those with high qualifications, continue to report a significant struggle to balance their professional and familial duties (Naguib and Aref 2023). This challenge, often described as the \u201ddouble burden\u201d, performing professionally by day and fulfilling domestic responsibilities by evening, has a direct negative impact on family cohesion and satisfaction (Al-Ghanim 2025; Al-Thani 2025). Research shows that work-family conflict negatively impacts job satisfaction (Buonocore and Russo 2013). This indicates that the availability of family-friendly policies does not always translate into a lived experience of work- life balance. In a recent survey, 23% of female public sector employees cited excessive family responsibilities, long working hours, and limited childcare or leave options as primary reasons for work-family imbalance (Naguib and Aref 2023). Furthermore, these progressive frameworks are almost exclusively a feature of the public sector.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 39, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f32d43f9e36d", "text": "imited childcare or leave options as primary reasons for work-family imbalance (Naguib and Aref 2023). Furthermore, these progressive frameworks are almost exclusively a feature of the public sector. The private sector significantly lags in the provision of comparable benefits, with fewer options for extended maternity leave, childcare support, or flexible work arrangements (Barbar, Naguib, and AbuHilal 2024). The DIFI policy report (Al-Motawaa 2024) specifically identifies the absence of formal policies for remote work, part-time jobs, and flexitime, as well as a lack of widespread Page 16 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 childcare support, as major gaps. The disparity between sectors reinforces the public sector as the only viable choice for many nationals who prioritize family compatibility, thereby deepening the structural divide in the labor market. The \u201cglass ceiling\u201d phenomenon in Qatar is partly attributed to this, as highly educated women are sometimes compelled to resign from prominent positions to prioritize familial obligations, a phenomenon researchers refer to as \u201cself-inflicted\u201d or the \u201cmommy track\u201d (Ansari 2022; Jannat 2025). These persistent gaps highlight the need for a more holistic approach that goes beyond legislation to address workplace culture, managerial support, and the extension of family-friendly policies to the private sector. 4.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 40, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5053c0811623", "text": "highlight the need for a more holistic approach that goes beyond legislation to address workplace culture, managerial support, and the extension of family-friendly policies to the private sector. 4. Policy Ramifications: Making the Private Sector More Attractive Making the private sector a more attractive career path for Qatari nationals is a complex policy challenge that requires a holistic and sustained egort. Simply enforcing employment quotas is insugicient; meaningful change depends on addressing the underlying drivers of public sector preference. This involves a multi-pronged strategy: evolving Qatarization beyond numbers to address employer constraints, bridging the critical education-to-work gap, actively enhancing work-life conditions in private firms, and concertedly reshaping social perceptions of employment. 4.1 Qatarization and Quota-Based Hiring: Beyond the Numbers and Private Employer Constraints The cornerstone of Qatar\u2019s labor market nationalization has been \u201cQatarization,\u201d a policy primarily implemented through a quota system requiring public and private sector entities to maintain a minimum ratio of Qatari workers. In certain strategic industries like oil and gas, this quota can be as high as 50% (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 41, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d6578d231f4c", "text": "and private sector entities to maintain a minimum ratio of Qatari workers. In certain strategic industries like oil and gas, this quota can be as high as 50% (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). The initial goal for Qatarization, established in 1997, was to reach a 20% national workforce in all sectors within four years, a target that most public sector authorities met quickly (Sayre, Benmansour, and Constant 2015). However, while the policy has been successful in ensuring employment for nationals, its implementation through rigid quotas has led to significant unintended consequences that undermine the policy\u2019s ultimate goal of meaningful economic integration (Elbanna and Fatima 2022). In response, recent legislative egorts show a renewed push. The Nationalisation of Jobs in the Private Sector Law No. (12) of 2024 mandates that private sector employers prioritize Qatari nationals for employment and training, preserving specific job roles for them. The law requires employers to register all vacancies on the Ministry of Labour\u2019s \u201cKawader\u201d platform and is expected to be fully implemented by April 2025 (Horne and Jones 2025; MoL 2024a). This challenge is amplified by a social contract founded on a rentier model, which ensures public- sector jobs and makes private sector employment less appealing (Ben Hassen 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 42, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_669d1ba78a0e", "text": "2025; MoL 2024a). This challenge is amplified by a social contract founded on a rentier model, which ensures public- sector jobs and makes private sector employment less appealing (Ben Hassen 2022). A primary challenge is the phenomenon of \u201cphantom employment,\u201d where private companies hire nationals simply to meet the quota, without integrating them into meaningful roles (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). These employees may be underutilized or, in some cases, not required to work at all, egectively creating a hidden subsidy paid by the private sector to fulfill a state objective. This practice is driven by several factors. For employers, it is often a pragmatic response to the high wage expectations of Qatari nationals and a perceived lack of requisite skills Page 17 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 for specific private sector roles (Elsharnouby et al. 2023). For some nationals, these arrangements are acceptable as they provide a secure income without the demanding schedules or performance pressures often associated with the private sector. This dynamic, however, is counter-productive, limiting skills transfer, hindering productivity, and reinforcing negative stereotypes about the national workforce\u2019s commitment and capabilities (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 43, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6c0231319bf0", "text": "-productive, limiting skills transfer, hindering productivity, and reinforcing negative stereotypes about the national workforce\u2019s commitment and capabilities (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). The challenges of Qatarization are not solely driven by employee preferences; private sector employers face legitimate constraints that hinder the meaningful hiring of nationals. First, Private firms, operating on profit-driven models, typically cannot compete with the high, state- subsidized wage structures and comprehensive benefits of the public sector. Second, some employers express concerns about labor laws that may complicate the process of managing underperformance or terminating national employees, creating a perceived risk that discourages hiring. Finally, there is a significant risk aversion related to investing in training and development. Private companies are hesitant to fund extensive training for Qatari nationals who, once upskilled, are highly likely to leave for more secure and lucrative positions in the public sector.

Despite heavy investment in world-class educational infrastructure, employers, particularly in technical and high-growth sectors like finance, report a significant gap in both practical experience and critical soft skills among graduates (Petrelli and Tamayo 2025). This underperformance is sometimes attributed to a widespread prevalence of rote learning in classrooms, which can hinder creativity and flexible thinking (Ben Hassen 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 46, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_52f96e9a3c73", "text": "etrelli and Tamayo 2025). This underperformance is sometimes attributed to a widespread prevalence of rote learning in classrooms, which can hinder creativity and flexible thinking (Ben Hassen 2022). A 2021 study on Qatar\u2019s finance and banking sector highlighted this disconnect, finding a clear gap between the curricula of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions and employer needs. Employers in the sector overwhelmingly prioritized social and personal skills, such as leadership, communication, and cultural awareness, while TVET program leaders placed a higher emphasis on technical skills (Said and Alhares 2021). Key skill deficiencies identified by employers include: \u2022 Technical and Practical Skills: A 2025 study of Qatar\u2019s financial sector found that while graduates may have strong theoretical knowledge, there is a primary shortage of technical skills and hands-on experience. Employers overwhelmingly prioritize candidates who already possess the job-ready skills (Petrelli and Tamayo 2025). \u2022 Soft Skills: Across various sectors, employers note a lack of crucial 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and leadership (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). \u2022 Work Experience: Internships and other forms of work-based learning are critical for developing personal and professional skills that cannot be acquired in a classroom setting (Anjum 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_967dec427d2c", "text": "2023). \u2022 Work Experience: Internships and other forms of work-based learning are critical for developing personal and professional skills that cannot be acquired in a classroom setting (Anjum 2020).

Public sector employment is characterized by shorter working hours, generous leave policies, and a high degree of job security, which are highly valued by Qatari nationals, especially women (Momani 2025). Indeed, long hours of work were a primary reason cited by unemployed Qatari women for not being willing to work in the private sector (Sayre, Benmansour, and Constant 2015). In contrast, the private sector is often perceived as demanding longer hours and ogering less stability, making it a less attractive option for those prioritizing family and personal life. The COVID-19 pandemic served as an unexpected national experiment in remote and flexible work, thrusting organizations and employees into new arrangements (Mahboob 2021).

Recent research confirms that Qatari employees report high levels of satisfaction with their work environment and job security, reflecting the positive conditions in the public sector where the majority are employed (Naimi 2024).

It also manifests in models like the \u201cpassive entrepreneur,\u201d where nationals secure a full-time public sector job and then start a business for extra income, viewing full-time entrepreneurship as too risky (Ben Hassen 2022). Conversely, vocational or \u201cblue-collar\u201d jobs are often stigmatized and viewed as belonging to the expatriate workforce (Elsharnouby et al. 2023). Surveys have quantified this preference; in 2013, 75% of unemployed Qatari women and 61% of unemployed men stated they were unwilling to work in the private sector (Sayre, Benmansour, and Constant 2015). A significant cultural factor that impacts perceptions of fairness and meritocracy is wasta, the practice of using personal connections and favouritism to gain advantages (Braikan 2024). The pervasive influence of wasta can undermine merit-based processes, leading to perceptions of unfairness and distrust, particularly regarding promotions and hiring in both sectors (Braikan 2024).

Conclusion The preference for public sector employment among Qatari nationals represents a fundamental challenge to Qatar\u2019s economic diversification. The public sector, supported by the wealth of a rentier economy and a deeply embedded social contract, has become the default employer of choice. It ogers unparalleled job security, superior compensation packages, and a work-life balance that the private sector struggles to match. This dynamic creates a structural divide that channels the nation\u2019s talent away from the private enterprises essential for a sustainable, knowledge-based economy. In contrast, the private sector, despite ogering dynamism and merit-based advancement, is perceived as unstable and less accommodating to cultural and family norms. It faces a Page 21 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 significant competitive disadvantage, not only in compensation but also in cultural prestige. This structural imbalance is exacerbated by a persistent skills gap, leaving many graduates ill- equipped for private sector demands and reinforcing the preference for government roles.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 54, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_241f2fe66010", "text": "ral prestige. This structural imbalance is exacerbated by a persistent skills gap, leaving many graduates ill- equipped for private sector demands and reinforcing the preference for government roles. If the private sector fails to become a viable and attractive career path for Qataris, the core objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030, particularly those related to economic diversification and human development, will be digicult to achieve. The sustainability of Qatar\u2019s long-term vision depends on a vibrant private sector powered by its own national talent. To bridge this divide, a multi-pronged policy response is essential. This includes recalibrating public sector incentives to narrow the benefits gap, alongside implementing family-friendly policies and strengthening social protections in the private sector. A critical component is the fundamental alignment of the national education system with the real-world needs of private enterprise, focusing on practical skills, internships, and work-based learning. By shifting the perception of private sector work from a secondary option to a respected and rewarding career path, Qatar can foster an inclusive, knowledge-based economy led by an empowered national workforce across all sectors.

Page 22 of 31 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team July 15th, 2025 Key Takeaways: 1. A Fundamental Preference: A deep-seated cultural and economic preference for public sector employment is the primary driver of the structural dichotomy in Qatar\u2019s labor market. 2. Security Over Dynamism: Qatari nationals prioritize the unparalleled job security, superior benefits, and work-life balance of the public sector over the potential for merit- based advancement in the private sector. 3. The Private Sector\u2019s Competitive Disadvantage: The private sector struggles to attract national talent due to a significant gap in compensation, benefits, and, crucially, cultural prestige. 4. Skills Mismatch as a Core Barrier: The misalignment between the education system\u2019s output and the private sector\u2019s needs reinforces the public sector preference and hinders successful Qatarization in private enterprise. 5.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-07-15", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 57, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q6_EN_2025-07-15_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-07-15", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a0b7fb252bfb", "text": "re Barrier: The misalignment between the education system\u2019s output and the private sector\u2019s needs reinforces the public sector preference and hinders successful Qatarization in private enterprise. 5. A Holistic Strategy is Essential for QNV 2030: Achieving a diversified, knowledge-based economy requires a coordinated strategy that enhances the attractiveness of the private sector through policy reform, educational alignment, and cultural change. 6. Changing Perceptions is Key: Beyond policy, long-term success depends on reshaping societal narratives to elevate the status of private sector careers, entrepreneurship, and vocational skills. Qatar\u2019s economic future depends on its ability to build a robust and dynamic private sector. The success of this vision is contingent not just on policy, but on making private enterprise a genuinely attractive and respected career path for the next generation of Qatari talent.

Introduction: The Expatriate Manager as a Keystone in Workforce Nationalization In the rapidly transforming economic landscape of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), workforce nationalization has emerged as a paramount strategic policy. For the State of Qatar, this initiative, known as \u201cQatarization,\u201d is not merely a labor market adjustment but a foundational element of its long-term developmental blueprint. Within this national project, the expatriate manager occupies a uniquely pivotal and complex position. Recruited for their global expertise and managerial acumen, these individuals are tasked not only with achieving corporate objectives but also with serving as the primary conduits for knowledge transfer and talent development, mentoring the very Qatari professionals intended to eventually assume their roles.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_547914cac14a", "text": "ng corporate objectives but also with serving as the primary conduits for knowledge transfer and talent development, mentoring the very Qatari professionals intended to eventually assume their roles. Page 2 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 This section establishes the strategic context of Qatarization, defines the inherent duality of the expatriate manager\u2019s role, and positions mentorship as the critical instrument through which the policy\u2019s human capital objectives are to be realized. 1.1 The Strategic Imperative of Qatarization: Context, Goals, and Progress The State of Qatar\u2019s economic trajectory is guided by the ambitious Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030), a strategic framework designed to navigate the nation away from the inherent volatilities and finite nature of a hydrocarbon-dependent economy (GSDP 2008). Launched in 2008, the vision is a direct policy response to the economic phenomenon known as the \u201cresource curse,\u201d or the paradox of plenty, where countries with an abundance of natural resources often experience slower economic growth, less democracy, and worse development outcomes (Badeeb, Lean, and Clark 2017). The \u201cresource curse\u201d concept itself is a well-established, though evolving, field of economic study (Kinnaman 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0595e4c0d0ee", "text": "th, less democracy, and worse development outcomes (Badeeb, Lean, and Clark 2017). The \u201cresource curse\u201d concept itself is a well-established, though evolving, field of economic study (Kinnaman 2023). QNV 2030 aims to short-circuit this paradox by orchestrating a structural transformation towards a diversified, competitive, and, crucially, knowledge-based economic model (GCO n.d.; Sharq Law Firm 2025). This transition is critical for fossil fuel export-dependent economies facing the prospect of global decarbonization, which could lead to significant fiscal and economic transition costs (Jensen 2023). Central to this grand strategy is the Human Development Pillar, which posits that the nation\u2019s most sustainable and valuable long-term asset is its own citizenry (GSDP 2008).

In a hyper-globalized environment, the policy is an explicit e\u2018ort toward \u201cmaintaining Qatar\u2019s national identity\u201d and preserving its traditional Islamic and family values (Elshenawy 2017). 1.2 Defining the Expatriate Manager\u2019s Dual Role: Performance Driver and National Developer Expatriate managers are recruited into the Qatari economy for a clear and specific purpose: to provide specialized skills, technical expertise, and international management experience that are not yet su\u2018iciently available within the local talent pool (Rodriguez and Scurry 2013). Their primary function, from a corporate perspective, is to drive business performance, manage complex projects, and ensure operational excellence. This role requires them to leverage their world-class standards and international expertise while adapting to a new culture and work environment (Ceric, Williams, and Ramudu 2013). Simultaneously, the policy of Qatarization imposes a second, equally critical mandate upon them. They are explicitly expected to function as national developers, with a core responsibility for knowledge transfer, training, and mentoring local Qatari talent (Al-Horr 2011; J. Williams, Bhanugopan, and Fish 2011).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_12db8306edf3", "text": "tly expected to function as national developers, with a core responsibility for knowledge transfer, training, and mentoring local Qatari talent (Al-Horr 2011; J.

This dual mandate creates an inherent structural conflict within the expatriate manager\u2019s position. The manager is hired and valued for their unique expertise, yet their success under the Qatarization mandate is measured by their ability to e\u2018ectively transfer their knowledge to their Qatari mentees, a process which, ironically, can mean \u201cdisplacing one\u2019s own employment with that of a national, making one\u2019s position obsolete\u201d (Ceric, Williams, and Ramudu 2013). This dynamic establishes a direct conflict of interest. Expatriates widely perceive the policy as a threat to their job security (Irfan et al. 2024). As a result, while their role o\u2018icially requires them to share knowledge, the situation creates a powerful unspoken incentive to engage in \u201cknowledge hoarding\u201d by withholding information as a means of professional self-preservation (Lee 2018).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_eb6ae942c9e3", "text": "ires them to share knowledge, the situation creates a powerful unspoken incentive to engage in \u201cknowledge hoarding\u201d by withholding information as a means of professional self-preservation (Lee 2018).

It is recognized as a vital mechanism for transferring skills, cultivating leadership potential, and integrating national talent into a globally competitive workforce (Ogunsola et al. 2023). This strategic view aligns directly with national policy, which calls for mechanisms to \u201cfacilitate skills transfer between high-skilled foreign employees and promising Qataris\u201d (GSDP 2011). The strategic importance of mentorship is reflected in the proliferation of both governmental and corporate initiatives. The government has established high-profile institutions like the Qatar Leadership Centre (QLC), and other public bodies, such as the Qatar National Library with its \u201cMurshidi Program,\u201d connect students and graduates with seasoned professionals (Ahmad et al. 2023).

This is particularly visible in vital industries like energy, where companies such as QatarEnergy LNG, North Oil Company (NOC), and QAPCO have established comprehensive national development programs, often featuring a \u201csponsorship\u201d model where senior managers mentor junior Qatari employees (Fakhouri 2019). Similar practices are crucial in other key sectors, such as the medical field at Hamad Medical Corporation (Suliman et al. 2018). Mentoring is thus seen as the essential bridge between the theoretical knowledge gained through formal education and the practical, tacit knowledge required to build succession pipelines and create the \u201chigh-calibre Qatari workforce\u201d envisioned by national leaders. The entire strategy rests heavily on the practical implementation of training and knowledge transfer from experienced expatriates to local employees (Irfan et al. 2024).

Motivations and Challenges: The Expatriate Mentor\u2019s Perspective The decision by an expatriate manager to fully engage in mentoring is a calculation based on a complex set of competing motivators and demotivators. While some may find intrinsic satisfaction in developing others, they also face significant barriers. These factors, which shape the expatriate manager\u2019s perspective, are categorized and detailed in Table 2. 2.1 The Psychological Contract: Expatriate Expectations vs. Organizational Realities The relationship between an employee and their organization is governed not only by a formal employment contract but also by a \u201cpsychological contract,\u201d which comprises the unwritten, implicit beliefs and expectations each party holds about their mutual obligations (Conway and Briner 2009). For expatriate managers, this contract is often multifaceted and carries heightened significance due to the substantial personal and professional risks involved in relocating.

Transactional terms are tangible and short-term, such as high compensation, benefits, and relocation packages. In contrast, relational terms are the more open-ended, long-term promises based on mutual trust and loyalty (Rousseau 2000). While transactional benefits are expected, it is the relational elements that often carry greater weight for an expatriate. These include the unspoken promises of meaningful career development, consistent organizational support, and a stable degree of job security throughout their assignment (Haslberger and Brewster 2009). The decision to move abroad for a job involves significant personal disruption, such as uprooting one\u2019s life and family. Because of these high stakes, the expatriate places greater importance on the psychological contract, as it represents the employer\u2019s unspoken commitment that this personal risk will be rewarded with career support and stability. Therefore, an expatriate\u2019s willingness to accept an international assignment is often based on a fundamental belief that the organization is making a long-term investment in their career, not just filling a temporary position (Haslberger and Brewster 2009).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 14, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1844b41db3b3", "text": "ational assignment is often based on a fundamental belief that the organization is making a long-term investment in their career, not just filling a temporary position (Haslberger and Brewster 2009). 2.1.2 Qatarization: A Source of Contract Strain and Breach The policy of Qatarization directly challenges the psychological contract of expatriate managers by creating a fundamental conflict between the organization\u2019s duties. On one hand, the organization must fulfill its state-mandated obligation to prioritize national talent. On the other hand, it has an implicit relational obligation to provide its expatriate employees with job security and opportunities for career advancement (Irfan et al. 2024; J. S. Williams 2014). This creates a perception that the organization\u2019s commitment to the state supersedes its commitment to them, leading to feelings of violation and diminished trust (Irfan et al. 2024). This ongoing tension frequently leads to a psychological contract breach, defined as an employee\u2019s perception that their organization has failed to fulfill one or more of its promises (Turnley and Feldman 2000). For an expatriate, this breach becomes tangible when they see career paths blocked or opportunities explicitly reserved for their less-experienced Qatari mentees, directly contradicting the promises of career growth that may have motivated their relocation (Aldossari and Robertson 2016). Because Qatarization is a continuous, long-term policy, this is not a singular event.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 15, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2bac34b7d5d9", "text": "tradicting the promises of career growth that may have motivated their relocation (Aldossari and Robertson 2016).

Instead, it is experienced as a chronic breach, a constant and unavoidable reminder of the precarious nature of their employment. 2.1.3 Contract Breach: Consequences for Commitment and Retention When expatriates perceive a breach of their psychological contract, the consequences are predictable and detrimental, manifesting in several negative behavioral outcomes (Turnley and Feldman 2000). The most critical consequences for the success of nationalization include: \u2022 Reduced Organizational Commitment: A sense that the organization has broken its promises erodes the expatriate\u2019s loyalty and willingness to exert maximum e\u2018ort. Research in Qatar confirms that the \u201cincreasing trend of Qatarization exhibits a negative impact on e\u2018ective and continuance commitment\u201d among expatriate employees (Coyle- Shapiro and Kessler 2000; Irfan et al. 2024).

This dynamic can be understood through the established psychological lens of Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, which posits that individuals are motivated to protect their valued resources, such as job security (Nguyen, Malik, and Budhwar 2022; Hobfoll 1989). The policy of Qatarization, by requiring expatriates to train, mentor, and develop their potential successors, creates a direct threat to this resource (Ceric, Williams, and Ramudu 2013). This places the expatriate manager in a professionally untenable position: to succeed in one aspect of their job (mentoring), they perceive they must risk failure in another (maintaining their employment).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_80bcddbd1b7f", "text": "laces the expatriate manager in a professionally untenable position: to succeed in one aspect of their job (mentoring), they perceive they must risk failure in another (maintaining their employment). This defensive reaction manifests as \u201cknowledge hiding,\u201d a concept defined in international literature as an intentional attempt to withhold or conceal requested knowledge (Connelly et al. 2012). This theoretical framework finds direct application in the Gulf context, where research on knowledge transfer in both Qatar and Saudi Arabia identified a deliberate \u201cDeter-Defer-Delay strategy for knowledge hiding\u201d explicitly linked to this sense of expatriate job insecurity (Lee 2018). \u2022 Defining the Dilemma: An intentional attempt by an expatriate manager to withhold or conceal knowledge from a Qatari mentee.

Crucially, these perceptions are not formed in a vacuum. They are often linked to socio-cultural realities, such as generous state welfare and the strong preference for secure public-sector employment, which can be misinterpreted by outsiders as a lack of ambition (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). This dynamic of mutual stereotyping creates a tense Page 8 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 environment that can directly harm the mentee\u2019s development; one study found such tensions reduced the self-confidence of Qatari mentees, hindering the entire mentoring process.

International research has identified a range of negative mentoring experiences that are not solely linked to fear of replacement but stem from other interpersonal, organizational, and skill-based factors (Simon and Eby 2003; Baranik, Roling, and Eby 2010).

A study at Hamad Medical Corporation confirmed this created mismatched expectations from the outset (Suliman et al. 2018).

EFectiveness of Mentorship: Bridging Gaps in Culture and Competency Evaluating the e\u2018ectiveness of expatriate-led mentorship requires moving beyond the manager\u2019s internal perceptions to assess the tangible outcomes of the mentoring process. This section analyzes the dynamics of cross-cultural knowledge transfer, examines mentorship\u2019s role in addressing specific skill shortages, and explores the profound impact of the local socio-cultural context. 3.1 Knowledge Transfer: The Dynamics of Cross-Cultural Exchange At its core, expatriate-led mentorship is a process of knowledge transfer. Organizations view expatriate managers as crucial vehicles for disseminating critical knowledge, which includes technical expertise, organizational routines, and corporate culture, from global headquarters to the local Qatari workforce. Expatriates, in this sense, function as agents of direct control (\u201cbears\u201d), as conduits for socialization into the corporate culture (\u201cbumble-bees\u201d), and as weavers of informal communication networks (\u201cspiders\u201d) (Harzing 2001). However, the path of this knowledge is fraught with cross-cultural complexities that can create \u201cinternal stickiness,\u201d impeding the flow of information and best practices within the firm (Szulanski 1996).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b4488729c962", "text": "er, the path of this knowledge is fraught with cross-cultural complexities that can create \u201cinternal stickiness,\u201d impeding the flow of information and best practices within the firm (Szulanski 1996). 3.1.1 Tacit Knowledge: The Core Transfer Challenge The central challenge in expatriate mentorship lies in transferring the right kind of knowledge. The most valuable expertise an expatriate brings is rarely the explicit knowledge that can be written down in a manual or taught in a classroom. Instead, it is the tacit knowledge: the intuitive, experience-based \u201cknow-how\u201d that governs e\u2018ective decision-making, political navigation, and nuanced leadership (Hocking, Brown, and Harzing 2004). This type of knowledge cannot be easily codified; it is transferred through direct, hands-on engagement, such as observation, shared experiences, and sustained mentoring relationships (Ismail 2015; Swap et al. 2001). The di\u2018iculty of this process creates a high degree of \u201cinternal stickiness,\u201d a term describing resistance to the flow of knowledge within an organization (Szulanski 1996). This resistance is not primarily about a lack of willingness, but about the recipient\u2019s absorptive capacity, which is their readiness to e\u2018ectively receive, internalize, and apply new, complex knowledge. For mentorship to succeed, the mentee\u2019s absorptive capacity must be built on two pillars: \u2022 Ability: The mentee must possess the foundational skills and qualifications to understand the knowledge being shared.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1113dc85a60d", "text": "ship to succeed, the mentee\u2019s absorptive capacity must be built on two pillars: \u2022 Ability: The mentee must possess the foundational skills and qualifications to understand the knowledge being shared. Page 10 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 \u2022 Motivation: The mentee must have the genuine drive to learn and the commitment to apply that learning. Both components are essential. A highly motivated mentee without the requisite background will struggle, just as a highly capable mentee without the drive to learn will fail to internalize the lessons. Therefore, e\u2018ective mentorship depends on both the mentor\u2019s ability to share tacit knowledge and the mentee\u2019s capacity to absorb it (Minbaeva et al. 2002). 3.1.2 Social Capital: The Foundation of Trust and Shared Vision The relationship between an expatriate mentor and a Qatari mentee is profoundly influenced by di\u2018ering cultural norms. A mutually respectful and trusting relationship is the paramount factor for success (Fakhouri 2019). This highlights the central role of social capital, which refers to the resources embedded within a network of relationships (Reiche, Harzing, and Kraimer 2009; Ismail 2015; Montazemi et al. 2012). This capital can be understood through three dimensions: structural (the network), relational (the trust), and cognitive (a shared vision) (Reiche, Harzing, and Kraimer 2009).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_732601276e70", "text": "Montazemi et al. 2012). This capital can be understood through three dimensions: structural (the network), relational (the trust), and cognitive (a shared vision) (Reiche, Harzing, and Kraimer 2009). \u2022 Trust: In a cross-cultural context, trust mitigates the uncertainty and anxiety inherent in intercultural interactions (Ismail 2015). For the expatriate to e\u2018ectively share nuanced information, they must trust that the mentee is genuinely engaged (Hsu et al. 2021). Building this trust often takes longer in the Gulf context, where relationships precede business (Dodds and Grajfoner 2018). Shared Vision: The development of a shared vision between the expatriate and the host-country national (HCN) helps bridge cultural and organizational divides, creating a common ground that facilitates communication and knowledge transfer (Montazemi et al. 2012). Research has demonstrated that a shared vision acts as a significant mediator in the transfer of knowledge between expatriates and local employees (Zulkifly, Ismail, and Hamzah 2020). 3.1.3 Cultural Dynamics: Key Cross-Cultural Dimensions Expatriate managers must develop a high degree of cultural intelligence to navigate the cultural di\u2018erences that can create friction.

The GLOBE study\u2019s findings on the Arab world, along with regional studies, provide a useful framework for understanding these dynamics (Thom 2006; Dodds and Grajfoner 2018). One key dimension is the expectation of paternalistic leadership, a style that combines strong discipline with \u201cfatherly benevolence\u201d (Jackson 2016). Western managers may misinterpret this style as purely authoritarian, missing the underlying expectation of care and personal support, which can lead to friction. Furthermore, a study at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar found that confusion between the developmental role of a mentor and the evaluative role of a supervisor was a significant source of mismatched expectations, reflecting the challenges of navigating high power-distance cultures (Suliman et al. 2018).

Cultural Intelligence (CQ) is a critical capability, defined as an individual\u2019s competence to function e\u2018ectively in culturally diverse settings (Setti, Sommovigo, and Argentero 2022). High CQ is a key predictor of successful bi-directional knowledge transfer (Zulkifly, Ismail, and Hamzah 2020) and is positively related to an expatriate\u2019s e\u2018ectiveness in knowledge sharing (Stoermer, Davies, and Froese 2021). This attribute is crucial for both parties: \u2022 For the Expatriate Mentor: High CQ allows the manager to accurately read cultural cues and adapt their communication style. \u2022 For the Qatari Mentee: A host country national (HCN) with high CQ is better able to understand the expatriate\u2019s communication style and navigate corporate culture, thereby increasing their \u201cabsorptive capacity\u201d for new knowledge (Szulanski 1996). Ultimately, the dynamics of knowledge transfer are bidirectional. While the expatriate mentors on technical matters, the HCN often acts as a mentor on local culture, a process known as reciprocal or reverse mentoring (Van Bakel et al. 2022). 3.2 Bridging Critical Skills Gaps: A Sectoral Analysis A significant challenge for Qatar\u2019s labor market is the persistent gap between the skills possessed by the workforce and the evolving demands of the economy.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 31, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8bed509dcaad", "text": "Critical Skills Gaps: A Sectoral Analysis A significant challenge for Qatar\u2019s labor market is the persistent gap between the skills possessed by the workforce and the evolving demands of the economy.

Addressing this gap is crucial for achieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030, which emphasizes a transition to a knowledge-based economy and a more diversified, competitive private sector (GSDP 2008). 3.2.1 The Skills Gap: Soft Skills vs. Technical Competencies Recent studies and analyses of the Qatari labor market reveal a consensus among employers that while technical skills (hard skills) are important, the most significant deficiencies lie in the realm of soft skills. A gap analysis of business students in Qatar found that employers place a high value on soft skills such as communication, adaptability, flexibility, and a strong work ethic (Alshare and Sewailem 2018). This finding is echoed in a study on the Qatari finance and banking sector, which identified a major mismatch between the perceptions of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program leaders and employers, particularly in social and civic skills (Said and Alhares 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3c69acdddd5a", "text": "fied a major mismatch between the perceptions of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program leaders and employers, particularly in social and civic skills (Said and Alhares 2021).

(iii) Stereotypes and workplace dynamics: Negative stereotypes can exist on both sides, with some employers questioning the work ethic and commitment of nationals, and some nationals feeling that expatriates are a threat to their job security (Fakhouri 2019; Lee 2018). This can hinder e\u2018ective knowledge transfer and mentorship, which are crucial for skills development. To address these issues, a multifaceted approach is needed that goes beyond simple quotas. This includes fostering a stronger work ethic through education and media campaigns, promoting the private sector as an attractive career option, and implementing robust mentorship and training programs to ensure that Qatari employees are equipped with the skills and competencies needed to succeed (Suliman et al. 2018). The development of leadership competencies among Qatari nationals is also seen as a critical element for the long-term success of Qatarization (Mistarihi 2021; Schnepfleitner and Ferreira 2021). 3.2.4 Knowledge Transfer: The Role of the Expatriate Workforce Given that expatriates constitute the vast majority of the labor force in Qatar (ILO Project O\u2018ice for the State of Qatar 2025; National Planning Council (NPC) n.d.), their role in bridging the skills gap is undeniable.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 36, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_7ce70e01c723", "text": "es constitute the vast majority of the labor force in Qatar (ILO Project O\u2018ice for the State of Qatar 2025; National Planning Council (NPC) n.d.), their role in bridging the skills gap is undeniable.

This reliance on expatriates for skill development often occurs through informal, on-the-job interactions. Dr. Al-Hajri\u2019s (2022) case study of a Qatari company highlights that key mechanisms for this informal learning include managerial coaching and team knowledge exchange, which can be either hindered or facilitated by factors such as leadership style and trust between colleagues. However, this process is not without its challenges: \u2022 Job insecurity: The very nature of Qatarization, which involves replacing expatriates with nationals, can create a sense of job insecurity among the expatriate workforce, leading to a reluctance to share knowledge and expertise (Lee 2018).

Ultimately, successful knowledge transfer requires a supportive organizational culture, a commitment from leadership, and a willingness on the part of both expatriates and nationals to engage in open and collaborative learning (Lee 2018; Fakhouri 2019). 3.3 Leadership Development: Cultivating the Next Generation of Qataris Beyond filling immediate technical and administrative skills gaps, a more profound goal of Qatarization is the development of a sustainable pipeline of indigenous Qatari leaders capable of steering the nation\u2019s key industries into the future (Ahmed 2018).

This ambition is a cornerstone of the Qatar National Vision 2030, which emphasizes the transition to a knowledge-based economy driven by skilled and capable citizens (Mohamed et al. 2022). This national ambition is also a direct response to the broader challenge of overcoming a \u201cresource curse mentality,\u201d where abundant natural wealth can lead to a reliance on state provisions and foreign expertise, potentially hindering the full development of local human capital (Brannagan and Grix 2023). The process therefore elevates the function of mentorship beyond simple training to encompass a more holistic developmental process that includes coaching, sponsorship, and role modeling. 3.3.1 Formal Structures: National Leadership Programs The State of Qatar has invested heavily in formal structures to support this goal. The Qatar Leadership Centre (QLC), for instance, o\u2018ers a suite of prestigious programs (the Rising Leaders Program, the Government Leaders Program, and the Executive Leaders Program) tailored to Qatari professionals at di\u2018erent stages of their careers (QLC n.d.-a).

While Qatari culture has its own leadership traditions, these programs are often designed to introduce and translate modern leadership concepts for a new generation (Schnepfleitner and Ferreira 2021).

In this capacity, a mentor is expected to provide their Qatari mentee with opportunities to lead projects, navigate complex organizational politics, and gain visibility with senior leadership. However, the e\u2018ectiveness of this crucial function is often severely constrained by multiple, overlapping challenges: \u2022 The Knowledge Hiding Dilemma: The inherent conflict where an expatriate is tasked with training their own replacement creates a significant barrier to genuine mentorship, driven by challenges of trust and job security (Jasimuddin and Saci 2022). Research on expatriate employees in Qatar confirms that the policy of Qatarization has a negative impact on their commitment, driven by the fear of being replaced (Irfan et al. 2024). \u2022 Defensive Behaviors: Empirical studies reveal that supervisors often engage in \u201cknowledge hiding,\u201d which is an intentional withholding of information to protect their job security and power. This behavior leads to distrust among supervisees, a dynamic that is particularly pronounced for foreign workers who experience higher levels of distrust when their supervisors hide knowledge (Arain et al. 2020). \u2022 Negative Perceptions of Localization: This situation is compounded by how expatriate managers perceive the policy itself. Studies in Qatar have shown that expatriates may view localization with \u201cunwillingness\u201d or \u201cdisinterest,\u201d seeing their primary mission as \u201cgetting the job done\u201d rather than enabling locals to take over.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 42, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_7b56501bdcea", "text": "dies in Qatar have shown that expatriates may view localization with \u201cunwillingness\u201d or \u201cdisinterest,\u201d seeing their primary mission as \u201cgetting the job done\u201d rather than enabling locals to take over. Concerns over \u201cjob security\u201d are prevalent, with expatriates fearing redundancy. Consequently, a sense of \u201cpessimism\u201d can arise where localization is perceived as merely an \u201cideal\u201d with no real implementation plans, often viewed as an obligation rather than a strategic priority (Ceric, Williams, and Ramudu 2013). These combined factors significantly temper an expatriate\u2019s willingness to fully engage in knowledge transfer and active mentorship, thereby stymying the development of true leadership capabilities among Qatari nationals. 3.3.3 Contextual Challenges: Local Realities vs. Global Models For leadership development initiatives to be successful, they must be highly attuned to the local context (Schnepfleitner and Ferreira 2021). Research highlights several critical challenges that can undermine their e\u2018ectiveness: Page 16 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 \u2022 Need for Contextual Alignment: There is often a disconnection between the theoretical, Western-centric models taught in formal programs and the practical realities of the Qatari workplace.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 43, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_75425df2bd1a", "text": "th, 2025 \u2022 Need for Contextual Alignment: There is often a disconnection between the theoretical, Western-centric models taught in formal programs and the practical realities of the Qatari workplace.

Within institutions like Qatar University, it involves a complex interplay of intrapersonal, relational, and institutional factors. E\u2018ective leadership development must therefore go beyond formal training to include relational aspects like peer support and senior leader influence, while also navigating institutional dimensions like strategic goals and organizational culture (Floyd et al. 2023). \u2022 Existing Leadership Competency Gaps: Empirical evidence from Qatar indicates that some top-level Qatari managers are not fully engaged in strategic leadership behaviors, often prioritizing day-to-day operational activities. Critical skills like mental agility, strategic vision, and a willingness to empower employees are often less pronounced, highlighting a \u201ccompetency gap\u201d that needs to be addressed through specialized training (Mistarihi 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 44, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_888ed621c112", "text": "agility, strategic vision, and a willingness to empower employees are often less pronounced, highlighting a \u201ccompetency gap\u201d that needs to be addressed through specialized training (Mistarihi 2021). \u2022 Socio-Cultural Barriers: The preference for secure, high-paying public sector employment, fueled by the \u201cresource curse mentality,\u201d leads to a disinterest among many Qatari males in pursuing private sector careers. In 2018, 81% of employed Qataris worked in the public sector, fundamentally limiting the pool of ambitious, private-sector-ready national talent for leadership development (Brannagan and Grix 2023). \u2022 Negative Expatriate Perceptions: Studies in Qatar have shown that expatriates may view localization with \u201cunwillingness\u201d or \u201cpessimism,\u201d seeing their primary mission as \u201cgetting the job done\u201d rather than enabling locals to take over.

This socio-cultural dynamic presents a formidable challenge to the perceived legitimacy and e\u2018ectiveness of formal, merit-based development programs, creating a parallel system of career advancement that directly impacts the roles of both expatriate mentors and their Qatari mentees. 3.4.1 Defining \u2018Wasta\u2019: From Social Connector to Corrupting Force Wasta is a well-known Arabic term, deeply ingrained in the culture of the Middle East, that functions as a form of social capital to gain preferential treatment (Al-Thbah 2021; Tlaiss and Kauser 2011).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_781bd12a5239", "text": "sta is a well-known Arabic term, deeply ingrained in the culture of the Middle East, that functions as a form of social capital to gain preferential treatment (Al-Thbah 2021; Tlaiss and Kauser 2011). It is an \u201cimplicit social contract\u201d that can oblige those in a position of power to provide favorable treatment to others within their group (Al-Thbah 2021). Historically, this served a positive function in resolving tribal disputes and assisting relatives (Al-Thbah 2021; Khalfan 2024). However, with the development of the modern state, the concept has largely shifted from a positive practice to a negative one, often becoming a form of administrative corruption used to obtain jobs, promotions, or services despite a lack of technical or educational qualifications (Al- Thbah 2021). This practice is rooted in the region\u2019s collectivist, high-context culture, which prioritizes personal relationships over professional ones (Khakhar and Alnajadah 2024). In such a context, building strong business relationships is a prerequisite for professional interaction. Wasta can therefore be seen as a mechanism for building trust and navigating bureaucracy in a society that is highly relational (S. Ali and Weir 2020). However, this has a clear \u201cdark side,\u201d as the practice can lead to nepotism, undermine fairness, and negatively impact organizational performance by prioritizing connections over competence (Al-Twal, Alawamleh, and Jarrar 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 48, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6ed3691350d5", "text": "rk side,\u201d as the practice can lead to nepotism, undermine fairness, and negatively impact organizational performance by prioritizing connections over competence (Al-Twal, Alawamleh, and Jarrar 2024). This dual nature makes Wasta a complex and challenging dynamic within organizations, functioning as what one ministry o\u2018icial described as the \u201cshadow system of governance\u201d (Al-Thani 2025). 3.4.2 Meritocracy: Wasta\u2019s Direct Challenge to Mentorship The entire premise of mentorship as a corporate HR intervention rests on the principles of meritocracy: that developing one\u2019s skills and competencies is the primary path to career success. This concept is often challenged in the Qatari context where advancement can be tied to connections rather than merit (Schnepfleitner and Ferreira 2021). This dynamic can actively delegitimize the mentorship process for both parties: Page 18 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 \u2022 For the Expatriate Mentor: As an outsider to the dense local networks where Wasta operates, the mentoring role can feel performative and futile.

In this way, Wasta does not merely compete with formal mentorship; it undermines its very foundation. Research from the region confirms this challenge, showing that the presence of Wasta reduces the incentive to compete on merit (Forstenlechner et al. 2011; Erumban and Al- Mejren 2024) and is often perceived as more important than qualifications for career progression (Tlaiss and Kauser 2011; Baranik, Gorman, and Wright 2021). 3.4.3 Formal HR Processes: The \u201cHijacking\u201d by Wasta The influence of Wasta extends beyond undermining mentorship; it can actively subvert and repurpose formal HR systems from within. Research shows how powerful local actors use Wasta to \u201chijack\u201d core HR processes like performance appraisal, turning them into tools for dispensing patronage to \u201cinsiders\u201d and marginalizing \u201coutsiders\u201d (Melhem et al. 2024). HR managers are central to this dynamic, acting as \u201crelational gatekeepers\u201d who can either perpetuate or curtail the influence of Wasta (Alsarhan, Horak, and Darwish 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 50, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_efc36cc588e4", "text": "ers\u201d (Melhem et al. 2024).

While the o\u2018icial \u201cespoused\u201d culture of an organization may promote meritocracy, the informal, embedded culture of Wasta creates a parallel power structure that determines actual outcomes, rendering the formal system a facade (Rahuman and Saif 2025). 3.4.4 The Expatriate Experience: Wasta as a Psychological Contract Breach The tension created by Wasta is particularly acute for expatriate managers and Qatari nationals who have been educated or have worked abroad. Research in the culturally similar context of Saudi Arabia found that for individuals accustomed to more meritocratic systems, the prevalence of Wasta is often perceived as a breach of the \u201cpsychological contract,\u201d which is the unwritten expectation that competence and performance are the basis for advancement (Aldossari and Robertson 2015). This perceived breach, fueled by a sense of injustice, leads to profound job dissatisfaction, demotivation, and ultimately, high turnover intentions (Aldossari and Robertson 2015). This dynamic is highly relevant to Qatar as it directly undermines the goals of Qatarization, which depends on retaining these skilled and internationally-experienced individuals to serve as mentors and leaders. 4.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 51, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3cfe4f5cbf28", "text": "highly relevant to Qatar as it directly undermines the goals of Qatarization, which depends on retaining these skilled and internationally-experienced individuals to serve as mentors and leaders. 4. Feedback and Policy: A Framework for an Enhanced Mentorship Ecosystem The complex perceptions and challenges faced by expatriate managers in their mentoring roles are not insurmountable. They can be significantly mitigated through a concerted and multi- layered approach involving strategic interventions at both the corporate and governmental levels. Page 19 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 Creating an environment where mentorship is perceived as a rewarding and e\u2018ective activity requires building a robust ecosystem of support. This involves strengthening the corporate sca\u2018olding through strategic human resource management (HRM) and leveraging governmental and institutional influence to foster a national culture that values and promotes mentorship. 4.1 Corporate ScaXolding: The Role of Strategic HRM The primary responsibility for creating a successful mentorship environment lies with the individual organizations employing expatriate managers and Qatari nationals.

Strategic HRM has a critical role to play in designing and implementing the necessary frameworks to facilitate e\u2018ective mentorship by moving beyond simple compliance to foster a genuine developmental culture (Budhwar et al. 2019). 4.1.1 Institutionalization: From Ad-Hoc to Structured Programs To be e\u2018ective, mentorship cannot be an afterthought; it must be institutionalized. Organizations must shift from informal assignments to structured programs with clear objectives and defined processes. The key components of this institutionalization include: \u2022 The Case for Formal Programs: While informal mentoring is often e\u2018ective, formal programs are a critical tool for ensuring developmental opportunities are distributed equitably and aligned with strategic goals (Ragins and Cotton 1999).

Formal programs must be carefully designed to replicate the supportive aspects of informal relationships to be successful (Underhill 2006). \u2022 Core Principles of a Structured Program: A UAE-based study proposed a set of core principles for successful programs, including \u201cstructured interaction, clear objectives, target dates, regular reflection on challenges, formal evaluation and remedial action\u201d (Kokt and Dreyer 2018).

It is important to note, however, that even well-designed programs may require more than 24 months to show a tangible impact on mentee productivity (Shore et al. 2024). 4.1.2 Cultural Attunement: The Foundational Role of CCT Crucially, mentorship programs must be designed with a high degree of cultural attunement.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 55, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8e322cb571c5", "text": "e impact on mentee productivity (Shore et al. 2024). 4.1.2 Cultural Attunement: The Foundational Role of CCT Crucially, mentorship programs must be designed with a high degree of cultural attunement. A recurring theme in the literature is the significant deficiency in specific and rigorous Cross- Cultural Training (CCT) for expatriates in the GCC, often because corporations mistakenly believe technical skills are the only prerequisite for success (Tahir and Ertek 2018). This is a critical oversight. E\u2018ective CCT is essential for aiding the socialization of expatriate managers and directly contributes to their success and adjustment in a new environment (Neill 2008). The cultural context directly impacts the feedback process, which is central to mentoring. For instance, research on Western-based health curricula in Qatar found that the local culture\u2019s high power distance made students reluctant to give direct feedback to supervisors (Wilbur, Bacha, and Abdelaziz 2017). An untrained expatriate mentor may misinterpret this indirect communication as agreement, thereby failing to provide e\u2018ective guidance. To be e\u2018ective, organizations must invest in a comprehensive CCT curriculum that is delivered both before arrival and on an ongoing basis. The training must be practical and cover several core areas: \u2022 Foundations of Qatari Culture: Islamic tradition, family/community solidarity, and typical behavioral norms.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 56, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2547435b330c", "text": "al and on an ongoing basis.

This directly addresses the core conflict that drives negative perceptions of mentoring. \u2022 Resolve the Core Conflict through KPIs: The structural paradox where developing a successor is perceived as a threat to one\u2019s career is empirically supported by research showing that localization policies can induce job insecurity and lead to negative outcomes like burnout and intentions to quit (I.

Research in the UAE identified that a best practice for successful nationalization was \u201clinking expatriate performance with achieving the targets of the WL [workforce localization] program\u201d to hold them accountable (Waxin, Kumra, and Zhao 2020). When an expatriate\u2019s annual performance review, bonus eligibility, and potential for future international assignments are explicitly and heavily weighted on their demonstrated success in mentoring, the dynamic shifts.

Ali et al. 2020; Minbaeva 2005).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 58, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_825853670bcf", "text": "sformation realigns the psychological contract, turning the Qatari mentee from a perceived replacement into a key project critical to the mentor\u2019s own advancement (I.

Public recognition or opportunities for further training can be powerful motivators (\u0160ajeva 2014). Mentoring also provides intrinsic rewards for the mentor, including a \u201csense of usefulness\u201d and \u201ca sense of respect and recognition,\u201d which fosters a deeper sense of achievement (\u0160ajeva 2014). Establishing systems for mentor recognition and tools to measure mentorship outcomes are potential \u201cleverage points\u201d that enhance the success and sustainability of a mentorship culture (Ren et al. 2024). Building trust is essential for the e\u2018icacy of these implicit, subjective rewards (Haesebrouck, Van Den Abbeele, and Williamson 2021). High-level recognition, such as Qatar\u2019s \u201dQatarization Crystal Awards,\u201d serves as a successful model for celebrating this contribution (QatarEnergy LNG 2023).

The tangible benefits of mentorship, ranging from favorable behavioral changes to improved career outcomes, justify this investment of public resources in strengthening mentorship frameworks (Eby et al. 2008).

Through its Institutional Programs, the QLC also partners directly with Qatari government and private sector organizations to design specialized courses, seminars, and mentorship tailored to their specific needs (QLC, n.d.-b). 4.2.2 National Policy: Legal and Strategic Frameworks The government\u2019s commitment to mentorship and talent development is embedded in its legal and strategic frameworks. A cornerstone of this is the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), developed by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) (MOEHE n.d.-a). The NQF is a mandatory reference tool designed to align education and training with labor market needs, enable alternative pathways to tertiary education, and establish occupational standards for relevant professions (Grainger et al. 2012; Supreme Education Council (SEC) 2011). Its core objectives of improving the transparency, comparability, and recognition of qualifications align with global trends (UNESCO et al. 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 63, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e54db9269b59", "text": "et al. 2012; Supreme Education Council (SEC) 2011). Its core objectives of improving the transparency, comparability, and recognition of qualifications align with global trends (UNESCO et al. 2023). This strategic direction is further supported by several key initiatives: \u2022 Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET): A formal national policy for TVET, guided by the O\u2018ice of TVET within the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, supports this strategic direction (UNESCO-UNEVOC 2020). \u2022 Labour Law No. (14) of 2004: Specifically, Labour Law No. (14) of 2004, Art. 27, mandates that employers of non-Qatari experts or technicians must train an appropriate number of Qatari workers to develop the skills necessary to take over these positions (MoL 2004). This legal requirement has been rea\u2018irmed and modernized in the Third National Development Strategy (Almeer, Bhatti, and Babar 2025). \u2022 Qatar National Occupational Classification (QNOC): To create a unified language for the labor market, the Ministry of Labour has developed the QNOC, which organizes economic sectors and human resources across all competencies based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO).

Such frameworks are critical, as international standards emphasize the need for a robust regulatory environment to ensure the quality and e\u2018ectiveness of apprenticeships and other work-based learning programs (International Labour Conference (ILC) 2019). The government operationalizes these frameworks through practical services such as the University Degree Equivalency/Attestation Service, which validates certificates against the Ministry\u2019s regulations (MOEHE n.d.-b), and the Profession Modification Service, which requires that education degrees be certified before a resident\u2019s professional title is changed, directly linking recognized qualifications to the labor market (MoL 2024a). 4.2.3 Sector-Specific Action: Public-Private Partnerships The Qatari government actively facilitates partnerships to embed leadership and mentorship development across the economy. This approach aligns with international best practice, which highlights that successful apprenticeship and training systems depend on robust implementation at the local level, requiring collaboration between employers, training providers, and government agencies (OECD/ILO 2017).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 65, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_44a5106511b2", "text": "cessful apprenticeship and training systems depend on robust implementation at the local level, requiring collaboration between employers, training providers, and government agencies (OECD/ILO 2017).

Page 25 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 4.2.4 National Culture: Fostering a Mentorship Ecosystem Beyond specific programs, governmental and institutional levers are crucial for shaping a national culture that values mentorship. This includes public recognition, certification, and awareness campaigns that frame mentorship as a vital component of national development. \u2022 Formal Recognition and Certification: The government can play a powerful role as a convener, strengthening the links between its national-level programs and corporate mentorship initiatives. Furthermore, the state could create a formal \u201cNational Mentor Certification\u201d program.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 67, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0b490121e4b8", "text": "as a convener, strengthening the links between its national-level programs and corporate mentorship initiatives. Furthermore, the state could create a formal \u201cNational Mentor Certification\u201d program. Such a credential, recognized by the Ministry of Labour, would be a valuable professional asset, benchmarked against globally recognized standards from bodies like the European Mentoring & Coaching Council (EMCC) and the International Coaching Federation (ICF) (European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) 2021). This is particularly critical because multinational corporations in the region often fail to provide adequate Cross-Cultural Training (CCT), a gap a government-endorsed standard could fill (Tahir and Ertek 2018). By professionalizing the role of the mentor through a certified, standards-based framework, Qatar would be adopting a strategy that mirrors European best practices, which emphasize the importance of enhancing the pedagogical skills and professional status of in-company trainers (European Commission 2025). \u2022 National Awards and Public Awareness: The government can also expand its system of recognition for contributions to nationalization. The Qatarization Crystal Awards in the energy sector are a successful model that could be replicated across other key industries (Salari 2024; Qatar News Agency (QNA) 2023). A powerful regional parallel is the NAFIS Award in the UAE (Nafis Award n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 68, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_dcaa6349d5c6", "text": "are a successful model that could be replicated across other key industries (Salari 2024; Qatar News Agency (QNA) 2023).

These e\u2018orts can be amplified through strategic public awareness campaigns to inspire young jobseekers (Emirates News Agency (WAM) 2022) and build a national identity around human capital (Almutairi and Kruckeberg 2019). 5. Conclusion The perception of the expatriate manager is the critical, and often overlooked, variable in the success of mentorship as a cornerstone of Qatar\u2019s nationalization strategy. This analysis reveals this perception is the logical outcome of a series of structural, psychological, and cultural pressures. The expatriate manager\u2019s role is defined by a central paradox: a mandate to develop local talent that directly conflicts with the rational instinct for professional self-preservation. This unresolved tension fosters an environment where mentorship is viewed as a threat, knowledge transfer is inhibited, and the full potential of Qatar\u2019s human capital remains unrealized.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 69, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_03ab18bcc31f", "text": "eservation. This unresolved tension fosters an environment where mentorship is viewed as a threat, knowledge transfer is inhibited, and the full potential of Qatar\u2019s human capital remains unrealized. The challenges are compounded by a complex cultural milieu, where the dynamics of high-context communication and the parallel system of career advancement through Wasta can delegitimize formal, merit-based development. However, these challenges are not intractable. Charting a path forward requires a deliberate re- engineering of the incentive structure at both the corporate and governmental levels. At the Page 26 of 41 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team September 9th, 2025 corporate level, organizations must move beyond passive compliance and build a robust strategic framework that realigns performance management to explicitly and substantially reward successful mentorship. At the national level, the government must continue to act as a catalyst, strengthening the ecosystem of support to foster a national culture of mentorship.

Key Takeaways: 1. The Central Paradox Creates a Chronic Psychological Contract Breach: The core conflict, where expatriate managers are mandated to train their own replacements, is widely perceived as a direct threat to their job security. This fosters a rational, defensive incentive to engage in \u201cknowledge hiding\u201d and constitutes a continuous breach of the psychological contract, eroding trust and commitment from the outset. 2. Cultural Intelligence (CQ) is as Critical as Technical Skill: The success of cross-cultural knowledge transfer, particularly of tacit \u201cknow-how,\u201d depends heavily on the Cultural Intelligence (CQ) of both the expatriate mentor and the Qatari mentee. A lack of CQ leads to miscommunication, broken trust, and failed mentoring relationships, regardless of the mentor\u2019s technical expertise. 3. \u2018Wasta\u2019s\u2019 Parallel System Invalidates Meritocracy: The pervasive influence of Wasta presents a direct challenge to the merit-based foundation of formal mentorship. It can delegitimize the entire process, creating cynicism and reducing the motivation for both mentors and mentees to invest in developmental work when an alternative path to advancement exists. 4.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 71, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c6fa4d745208", "text": ". It can delegitimize the entire process, creating cynicism and reducing the motivation for both mentors and mentees to invest in developmental work when an alternative path to advancement exists. 4. Realigning Incentives Is the Critical Solution: The most powerful tool to resolve the central paradox is to realign performance management systems. By making the successful development and advancement of Qatari mentees a core, heavily-weighted Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for expatriate managers, their personal success becomes directly linked to the success of their mentees, turning a threat into an opportunity. 5. A Structured Corporate Framework is Essential: Ebective mentorship cannot be left to chance. Organizations must move beyond ad-hoc assignments to a formal, institutionalized framework that includes structured programs, clear objectives, and mandatory, rigorous Cross-Cultural Training (CCT) to equip mentors with the skills needed to navigate the local context. 6. Government Must Act as an Ecosystem Catalyst: Beyond corporate action, the government has a crucial role in fostering a national culture of mentorship. This is achieved by strengthening the ecosystem through enhanced public-private partnerships, creating prestigious national awards for mentor and company excellence, and establishing formal certification standards to elevate the status and quality of mentorship as a key contributor to national development. 7.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-09-09", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 72, "total_chunks": 108, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q7_EN_2025-09-09_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-09-09", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fe5ecc11ca47", "text": "ous national awards for mentor and company excellence, and establishing formal certification standards to elevate the status and quality of mentorship as a key contributor to national development. 7. Targeted Mentorship for Women and Youth is a Strategic Imperative: To fully realize the goals of NDS3, mentorship programs must be intentionally designed to support the advancement of women and youth. Tailored sponsorship and mentorship are critical tools for building a diverse leadership pipeline and integrating the next generation into a competitive, private sector-driven economy.

Introduction: Diversifying Toward a Clean, Digital, and Productive Economy 1.1 Economic Diversification: The Imperative for a New Growth Model Qatar\u2019s vision to transform into a diversified, knowledge-based economy by 2030 hinges on a strategic pivot from its legacy concentrations in oil & gas and finance into high-productivity emerging domains, principally clean energy and advanced digital technologies. This transition is not merely about sectoral diversification but about fundamentally enhancing the nation\u2019s economic complexity and productivity to ensure long-term prosperity. Qatar\u2019s high dependence on hydrocarbons makes it vulnerable to volatile global energy prices and necessitates a transition to a more sustainable economic model (Al-Sulaiti et al. 2024). Launched in 2008, the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) sets the long-term direction for human, social, economic, and environmental development through its four pillars. It remains the foundational reference for any workforce nationalization (Qatarization) policy that seeks to nurture nationals in new, niche areas (General Secretariat for Development Planning (GSDP) 2008; Government Communications Ofice (GCO) n.d.; International Media Ofice (IMO) n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1b708d381a26", "text": "olicy that seeks to nurture nationals in new, niche areas (General Secretariat for Development Planning (GSDP) 2008; Government Communications Ofice (GCO) n.d.; International Media Ofice (IMO) n.d.). The vision aims to transform Qatar into an advanced society capable of sustainable development by fostering a diversified and competitive economy (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Afairs (UNDESA) n.d.). This involves a gradual reduction in its dependence on hydrocarbon industries while elevating the role of the private sector (Al-Sulaiti et al. 2024). The overarching Page 2 of 37 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team August 28th, 2025 goal is to balance modernization with the preservation of traditions, manage economic growth, and ensure the well-being of current and future generations (GSDP 2008; IMO n.d.). Achieving the goals of QNV 2030 requires overcoming significant challenges. The transition to a knowledge-based economy necessitates substantial reforms in education and training to cultivate a skilled workforce that can drive innovation (Mohamed and Koc 2017). Furthermore, it requires the development of a robust institutional framework that can efectively support a diversified economy (Nachef, Jantan, and Boularas 2014). A key challenge lies in shifting from a public sector-led growth model to one driven by a vibrant private sector (Bi and Miyajima 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2f577c3f65c7", "text": "ort a diversified economy (Nachef, Jantan, and Boularas 2014). A key challenge lies in shifting from a public sector-led growth model to one driven by a vibrant private sector (Bi and Miyajima 2024). This requires creating a business environment that is attractive to both domestic and foreign investment (GCO n.d.). While Qatar has made strides in improving business eficiency and attracting foreign direct investment, areas such as labor market reforms and fostering a more competitive environment for businesses require further attention (Bi and Miyajima 2024; Al- Qahtani and Shirazi 2023). The journey toward economic diversification is a long-term endeavor that demands sustained efort and strategic planning. While Qatar has made significant investments in education, research, and infrastructure, the transition to a knowledge-based economy is still a work in progress (Mohamed and Koc 2017). Successfully navigating this transition will require a concerted efort from all stakeholders, including the government, the private sector, and the academic community (Al-Sulaiti et al. 2024). 1.2 Strategic Enablers: The Rise of Digital and Clean Energy Sectors Recent national strategies have sharpened the path toward economic diversification laid out in the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_abfa22cfb9ff", "text": "ategic Enablers: The Rise of Digital and Clean Energy Sectors Recent national strategies have sharpened the path toward economic diversification laid out in the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030). The vision\u2019s economic development pillar explicitly calls for the responsible exploitation of hydrocarbon resources while simultaneously building a diversified, knowledge-based economy characterized by innovation and entrepreneurship (GSDP 2008). The Third Qatar National Development Strategy (QNDS3, 2024-2030) and the National Digital Agenda 2030 (DA2030) translate this vision into concrete action, emphasizing digitization, innovation, and sustainability as the core engines of future growth (Council of Ministers Secretariat General n.d.; Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) n.d.). QNDS3 is particularly ambitious, aiming to accelerate economic growth to an average of 4% per year, driven by expanded gas production and economic diversification (Council of Ministers Secretariat General n.d.; GCO 2024).

This global trend raises a core question for Qatar\u2019s economic strategy: How can Qatarization evolve, by using targeted policies, programs, and incentives, to rapidly and credibly develop national talent for these niche, high-skill domains while aligning with QNV 2030\u2019s sustainability pillars? International evidence confirms that the transition toward a low-carbon economy, coupled with digitalization, is poised for modest net job creation globally. However, this positive outcome is not automatic and hinges on efective policy measures to manage significant workforce displacement and skills mismatches (Hanna, Heptonstall, and Gross 2024; International Labour Organization (ILO) 2024b).

Answering this core policy question is therefore fundamental to achieving the economic diversification and productivity goals of QNV 2030 and QNDS3. This focus on human capital is a recognized component of Qatar\u2019s national strategies; for instance, the National Climate Change Action Plan identifies the development of \u201cenvironmental education and human capital\u201d as a key enabler for successful implementation (Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC) 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5c5157ea3171", "text": "e Change Action Plan identifies the development of \u201cenvironmental education and human capital\u201d as a key enabler for successful implementation (Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC) 2021).

Challenges to Qatarization: Identifying Gaps and Constraints in Emerging-Sector Skills This section analyzes the primary obstacles to developing a national workforce capable of leading Qatar\u2019s new emerging sectors. It begins by identifying the specific structural skill gaps in high-demand fields such as AI, cybersecurity, clean energy, and sustainable finance. Subsequently, it examines the critical discontinuities in the talent pipeline that prevent skilled individuals from entering the workforce. Finally, the section assesses the broader challenges of policy coordination and incentive alignment that hinder efective talent development. 2.1 Identifying Structural Skill Gaps: An Analysis of High-Demand Roles The rapid pace of technological adoption and the strategic pivot toward a knowledge-based economy have created a foundational challenge: a mismatch between the current workforce\u2019s skills and the specialized competencies demanded by new industries.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 13, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2257174d55be", "text": "strategic pivot toward a knowledge-based economy have created a foundational challenge: a mismatch between the current workforce\u2019s skills and the specialized competencies demanded by new industries.

There are notable shortages in specialized roles such as MLOps engineers, cloud data engineers, AI security specialists, and advanced Arabic NLP practitioners. This challenge is particularly acute given that Qatar\u2019s national AI strategy explicitly focuses on leveraging data and AI for economic diversification, with a stated ambition to become a world leader in the field by 2030 (Hanafi, Kshetri, and Sharma 2021). The strategy identifies \u201cdata access\u201d as a paramount pillar, aiming to build a robust data infrastructure and create a data- sharing program with standardized, AI-ready data (Albous, Al-Jayyousi, and Stephens 2025; Qatar Center for Artificial Intelligence (QCAI) 2019). However, the ambition is met with significant talent constraints. A recent analysis highlights that while GCC countries perform well in ambition, key capability gaps exist in skills, investment, and research, with talent remaining a primary constraint. Despite national skilling programs, Qatar has not yet built a sustainable, scaled AI talent ecosystem (Awad et al. 2025). The shortage extends beyond general AI talent to specific, high-demand niches. The need for cloud data engineers is amplified by the fact that cloud infrastructure is the essential backbone for a modern AI ecosystem, facilitating the storage, processing, and analysis of vast datasets (Gelvanovska-Garcia, Rossotto, and Ma\u010diul\u0117 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 15, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9f3ed4d24b84", "text": "ct that cloud infrastructure is the essential backbone for a modern AI ecosystem, facilitating the storage, processing, and analysis of vast datasets (Gelvanovska-Garcia, Rossotto, and Ma\u010diul\u0117 2024). This is critical as 70% of generative AI startups globally depend on such cloud infrastructure, and Qatar has prioritized the expansion of its high-performance computing (HPC) and data center capacity (Yuan 2025). Furthermore, the scarcity of advanced Arabic NLP practitioners is a crucial gap. Qatar has a strategic focus on developing Arabic-centric AI as a matter of national and cultural identity (ESCWA 2025; QCAI 2019). This is exemplified by QCRI\u2019s development of advanced models and benchmarking tools like LAraBench, which evaluates large language models for Arabic NLP and speech processing tasks (Abdelali et al., 2024). However, the very existence of such advanced research highlights the gap between academic leadership and the limited pool of practitioners available to commercialize these technologies or apply them at scale across the economy.

This demand surge occurs amidst a significant global cybersecurity workforce gap, which was estimated at 3.4 million professionals in 2022 (NCSA 2024b). The supply of qualified nationals remains thin relative to the rapid adoption of hyperscaler cloud services and specialized technologies in critical sectors. Key areas with notable skill shortages include: \u2022 Operational Technology (OT) Security: The increasing convergence of Information Technology (IT) and OT systems within Qatar\u2019s critical national infrastructure, particularly the energy sector, has created a pressing need for specialized OT security professionals.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3c1a2da65e0a", "text": "e of Information Technology (IT) and OT systems within Qatar\u2019s critical national infrastructure, particularly the energy sector, has created a pressing need for specialized OT security professionals. Unlike traditional IT environments where confidentiality is the priority, OT systems prioritize the availability, safety, and resilience of physical processes and industrial control systems (ICS) (Roshanaei 2021). Job market analysis shows that OT cybersecurity roles are typically not entry-level, requiring an average of nearly eight years of prior professional experience and specialized knowledge of standards like IEC 62443 (Ramezan, Cofy, and Lemons 2023). This high barrier to entry makes it dificult to quickly develop a local talent pipeline capable of defending against threats to critical infrastructure. \u2022 AI Security and Audit: The national push towards a knowledge-based economy involves the broad adoption of AI. However, these systems introduce unique risks such as data poisoning, model extraction, and privacy violations that require specialized oversight (NCSA 2024a). The NCSA\u2019s guidelines call for AI systems to be robust, safe, fair, and transparent, creating a need for AI model security auditors who can assess these complex systems for vulnerabilities and ethical compliance (MCIT 2024c).

These skills are distinct from traditional cybersecurity and are currently scarce. \u2022 Cloud Security: While the adoption of hyperscale cloud services provides access to advanced security tools, it also introduces the complexity of a \u201cshared responsibility model\u201d (Qiang and De Salins 2025). Under this model, the cloud provider secures the cloud infrastructure, but the client organization is responsible for securing what is in the cloud, including data access controls, network configurations, and application security. This creates a strong demand for professionals with skills in cloud security architecture and governance to manage these responsibilities, a skill set that is in short supply. 2.1.3 Clean Energy Systems A pressing need exists for expertise in desert-climate PV performance analytics, anti-soiling robotics, advanced grid integration, energy storage solutions, green hydrogen feasibility studies, and CCS project engineering. The challenge of localizing these roles is amplified by Qatar\u2019s unique environmental and industrial context. For example, the severe soiling efect in the MENA Page 7 of 37 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team August 28th, 2025 region, where dust can reduce PV eficiency by up to 50% in a few months (Shenouda, Abd-Elhady, and Kandil 2022), creates a critical and highly specialized demand for technicians and engineers.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_20ed1a9a1379", "text": ", 2025 region, where dust can reduce PV eficiency by up to 50% in a few months (Shenouda, Abd-Elhady, and Kandil 2022), creates a critical and highly specialized demand for technicians and engineers. These professionals must go beyond standard deployment and be skilled in performance analytics specific to desert conditions to accurately model and mitigate significant power losses (Sep\u00falveda-Oviedo 2025). This environmental reality directly fuels a skills gap in anti-soiling robotics, requiring specialists who can develop next-generation coatings and robotics to prevent long-term abrasion of panel surfaces, a key research area for QEERI (Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) n.d.; SOLAR MAG 2022). Similarly, integrating large-scale solar assets like the Al Kharsaah plant into the national grid creates a deficit in local expertise for managing intermittency and ensuring stability (Cavus 2025; Saleh, Hilal, and Haggag 2022). Furthermore, as Qatar aims to leverage its natural gas reserves for a transition towards a hydrogen economy, there is a pronounced scarcity of talent for green hydrogen feasibility studies and CCS project engineering. These fields require a multidisciplinary skill set to address challenges ranging from the high cost of electrolysis and water scarcity to the complex engineering of large- scale carbon capture facilities (Khan and Al-Ghamdi 2023; Eljack and Kazi 2021; Mohammed et al., 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b861f96d9a9f", "text": "ging from the high cost of electrolysis and water scarcity to the complex engineering of large- scale carbon capture facilities (Khan and Al-Ghamdi 2023; Eljack and Kazi 2021; Mohammed et al., 2024).

The university has been a primary local source of graduates in disciplines essential to the national economy, having graduated over 1,500 students (Elbashir and Parsaei 2015; McGee 2024). Its closure creates an immediate and substantial gap in the supply of domestically educated, high-skilled engineering talent. This situation heightens the immediate reliance on alternative pathways, such as the government\u2019s established overseas scholarship programs, which must now be strategically leveraged to fill the specific, high-skill gaps created by TAMUQ\u2019s departure (Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) n.d.- a; n.d.-b).

This lack of specific requirements creates ambiguity for training institutions and job seekers, weakening the market\u2019s incentive to develop talent in these new, critical sectors. The nation\u2019s PPP framework is a prime example. Law No. (12) of 2020 provides a strong legal basis for partnerships on major infrastructure and public service projects (Al-Sulaiti, Cid, and Ntai 2025; State of Qatar 2020). The oficial Public Private Partnerships Guidebook further details the process (Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) 2025). However, the crucial step of translating broad national goals into specific, mandatory skills-development clauses within these large-scale contracts is not yet systematic.

In contrast, targeted regulations in the financial sector demonstrate how efective this approach can be. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) has proactively shaped a modern regulatory landscape with its FinTech Strategy and specific guidelines for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Data Handling (QCB 2025a; 2024b; 2023a).

This policy directly confronts the most significant challenge facing enterprises today: a critical skills gap in the AI-driven economy, where a majority of leaders are now unwilling to hire talent that lacks AI skills (Johnson 2025). By leveraging micro-credentials, a globally recognized tool for mapping skills to high-demand digital roles (Gamage and Dehideniya 2025; McGreal et al. 2022), this approach not only builds a job-ready workforce but also serves as a core component of ensuring a \u2018just transition\u2019 for the MENA region (ILO 2024c; Gazzo et al. 2024).

This vital connection transforms a certificate into a tangible career opportunity and creates a clear, high-value pathway from skilling to employment (World Bank 2016). 3.1.2 AI Safety & Security Academy As Qatar accelerates its adoption of AI, it exposes its critical energy, finance, and government sectors to a new class of security risks. The global cybersecurity workforce already faces a significant talent deficit, a challenge compounded by the sophistication of AI-specific threats like data poisoning and model extraction (Dkaidek and Rashid 2024; Oladimeji, Egon, and Broklyn 2024; OECD 2023b). To address this vulnerability, this policy proposes establishing a cross- ministry AI Safety & Security Academy, operationalizing the National Cyber Security Agency\u2019s (NCSA) AI security guidelines (NCSA 2024a), creating a national pipeline of certified professionals in high-demand, niche roles like AI security assessors, model risk managers, and AI red-teamers.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1dc87f8ded86", "text": "\u2019s (NCSA) AI security guidelines (NCSA 2024a), creating a national pipeline of certified professionals in high-demand, niche roles like AI security assessors, model risk managers, and AI red-teamers. The academy\u2019s mission would be to cultivate certified professionals in niche, high-demand roles such as AI security assessors, model risk managers, and AI red-teamers. This parallels the emergence of new accountability professions, such as the independent AI auditors now required in other jurisdictions (Groves et al. 2024). For the academy\u2019s graduates to be efective, their training must be intensely practical, as international research confirms that hands-on, simulation-based methods are most efective for complex cyber roles (Pr\u00fcmmer, Van Steen, and Van Den Berg 2023). A core feature should be the use of regulated cloud sandboxes. This is a global best practice for building national cyber resilience by allowing for the safe testing of emerging technologies (Qiang and De Salins 2025; Appaya, Gradstein, and Haji Kanz 2020). By providing trainees with experience in these sandboxes, the academy can ensure its graduates are job-ready, equipped with the practical skills needed to secure Qatar\u2019s AI ecosystem and build national cyber resilience. 3.1.3 Clean Energy Field Engineer Track Qatar\u2019s strategic pivot to clean energy, marked by major investments in solar, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and hydrogen, creates a significant diversification and employment opportunity.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_43ad617e9294", "text": "Track Qatar\u2019s strategic pivot to clean energy, marked by major investments in solar, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and hydrogen, creates a significant diversification and employment opportunity.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that by 2025, investment in clean energy will be double that of fossil fuels (IEA 2025). Qatar\u2019s national strategy to mobilize at least $75 billion for sustainable investments by 2030 is therefore not just a financial goal, but a workforce development imperative that requires a pipeline of skilled national talent (Invest Qatar 2022; QCB 2025b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 35, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8f6839df054b", "text": "for sustainable investments by 2030 is therefore not just a financial goal, but a workforce development imperative that requires a pipeline of skilled national talent (Invest Qatar 2022; QCB 2025b). These new roles demand a sophisticated understanding of how to identify, quantify, and manage complex climate-related financial risks, including physical and transition risks (Baudino and Svoronos 2021; Korzeb et al. 2024). The use of AI in financial modeling further elevates this need, requiring professionals who can manage system vulnerabilities responsibly (Financial Stability Board (FSB) 2024). This is a strategic priority, as banks with stronger ESG capabilities demonstrate greater resilience and higher asset quality (Cantero-Saiz, Polizzi, and Scannella 2024). This global skills gap creates an opportunity for Qatar to build a competitive advantage through targeted human capital development, allowing its financial institutions to capitalize on the economic benefits of leading the transition to a sustainable economy (Financial Services Skills Commission 2024; ILO 2024c). To meet this demand, this policy advocates for the co-design of QCB-aligned micro-credentials that are directly tied to the job roles emerging from the new regulatory landscape. By developing these certifications in partnership with the financial sector, their market relevance and value are assured (Varadarajan, Koh, and Daniel 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 36, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3098068ab685", "text": "rging from the new regulatory landscape.

International experience demonstrates that government procurement and sector regulation are powerful levers to create this demand, shifting skills development from a peripheral corporate social responsibility activity into a core business requirement (OECD 2023a). This approach translates high-level national strategies into concrete, binding commercial obligations, ensuring that major national projects function not only as infrastructure developments but also as engines for building human capital (Jones 2022). 3.2.1 PPP Skills Clauses In line with Qatar\u2019s PPP Law No. 12 of 2020, it is critical to mandate the inclusion of Skills Development Obligations (SDOs) in all major infrastructure PPPs (State of Qatar 2020). The nation\u2019s PPP framework provides a strong legal basis for such partnerships, and the oficial Public Private Partnerships Guidebook further details the process (MOCI 2025).

Efective skills-focused partnerships require clear operational guidelines and shared responsibilities for training, infrastructure, and graduate placement pathways to succeed (ILO Country Ofice for Bangladesh 2018). While Qatar\u2019s PPP framework allows for these obligations, making them a standard and required component of contracts is essential to creating consistent, market-wide demand for national talent. 3.2.2 Regulator-Driven Talent Signals Beyond procurement, targeted regulations in key sectors can create powerful, market-wide demand for specific skills. This approach aligns with the recognition of public procurement as a strategic instrument for achieving government policy goals (OECD 2023a). This requires regulated firms in finance and technology to file annual Qatari Talent Plans for priority roles and could tie incentives, such as those for data hosting, directly to the employment and training of certified nationals in cloud and cybersecurity roles. This approach aligns with a significant global trend towards making human capital a core component of corporate disclosure and regulatory oversight.

This approach aligns with a significant global trend towards making human capital a core component of corporate disclosure and regulatory oversight. For instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has modernized its disclosure rules to explicitly include human capital resources as a topic material to understanding a business, viewing it as an important driver of long-term value (SEC 2022). Similarly, the European Union\u2019s new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) mandate detailed disclosure on a company\u2019s \u201cOwn Workforce\u201d (ESRS S1), covering training and skills development, which compels companies to measure, manage, and report on their human capital strategies (OECD 2023a). By creating similar regulatory requirements, Qatar can ensure that talent development becomes a strategic priority for key firms, rather than an afterthought.

Successfully transforming research into production-grade applications requires deliberate, structural bridges that connect academia and industry. These bridges facilitate the mobility of talent and ideas, ensuring that research is focused on real-world problems and that a pipeline of skilled nationals is developed to lead new sectors. Two powerful mechanisms for building this connectivity are co-funded advanced degrees with embedded residencies and the establishment of sectoral incubators and testbeds. 3.3.1 Co-funded Industry PhDs and Professional Master\u2019s A proven method for fostering knowledge transfer is through collaborative doctoral education programs that embed students within an industrial context (Kunttu, Huttu, and Neuvo 2018). These programs, often called \u201cindustrial doctorates,\u201d are educational tools designed to build bridges between the academic and industrial sectors by having PhD candidates carry out research while being employed in a knowledge-based company (Roolaht 2015). This model creates what are known as \u201cboundary spanners,\u201d who are doctoral students and graduates that can form a bridge between academia and industry by transferring new scientific competencies, fresh insights, and innovative mindsets directly into the industrial R&D domain (Kunttu, Huttu, and Neuvo 2018; Kneale et al. 2024). This embedded approach provides substantial benefits for all stakeholders.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 41, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_05c171868212", "text": "sights, and innovative mindsets directly into the industrial R&D domain (Kunttu, Huttu, and Neuvo 2018; Kneale et al. 2024).

Industrial PhD students gain contextual understanding, tacit knowledge, and access to data and networks that are invaluable for their research and career development (Bernhard and Olsson 2023). For companies, these programs ofer a direct channel to influence research, ensuring it addresses their real-world challenges, and provide access to a pipeline of highly skilled, industry-ready talent already familiar with the corporate environment (Compagnucci and Spigarelli 2024; Kunttu, Huttu, and Neuvo 2018). For the national economy, this model accelerates the development of a high-skilled, specialized domestic workforce capable of translating advanced research into commercial value. Funding advanced degrees in AI, cyber, and energy systems that require embedded residencies in national companies or ministries ensures research is focused on solving tangible, real-world problems. 3.3.2 Sectoral Incubators and Testbeds Complementing human capital initiatives requires physical and regulatory infrastructure where innovation can be safely tested, validated, and prepared for market deployment.

Furthermore, Qatar is already building the foundational infrastructure to solve this mismatch with the recent launch of the Qatar National Occupational Classification (QNOC) (MoL 2024c). This initiative aims to create a unified and comprehensive national reference for occupational data, which will serve as the cornerstone for a new Labour Market Information System (LMIS) designed to directly connect educational curricula with labor market needs (MoL 2024a). To ensure these national credentials are also recognized internationally by employers, the next logical step is to accelerate the mapping of QNOC to global frameworks like the European Skills, Competencies, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) (NPC 2025). 4.2.3 Over-reliance on Expatriates Failure to build national leadership can perpetuate dependency. \u2022 Mitigation: Vigorously use SDOs, critical occupation incentives, and diaspora fellowships to accelerate the placement of nationals into leadership roles. A powerful approach would be to adopt Global Skill Partnership (GSP) models, which are bilateral agreements that link training in the origin country (Qatar) to the specific needs of employers, both domestically and internationally.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-28", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 54, "total_chunks": 95, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q8_EN_2025-08-28_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9cce75926b67", "text": "adopt Global Skill Partnership (GSP) models, which are bilateral agreements that link training in the origin country (Qatar) to the specific needs of employers, both domestically and internationally.

From Education to Employment: Closing the persistent skills gap requires moving beyond traditional education to integrated pathways, including industry-aligned micro- credentials, co-funded professional master\u2019s/PhDs, and reserved internship slots that lead directly to employment. 4. Demand-Side Policies are Crucial: Policy must actively create market demand for national talent by embedding Skills Development Obligations (SDOs) in PPPs and government procurement, and using regulatory levers to incentivize the hiring of certified nationals. Supply-side skilling eforts will only succeed if they are met with clear, powerful, and consistent demand from the market. 5.

Risk Mitigation is Key: Proactive measures are needed to mitigate significant risks identified in this report, such as the closure of TAMUQ, the potential for credential-to-job mismatch, and over-reliance on expatriate labor in leadership roles. Taken together, these principles form a cohesive and actionable framework designed to transform Qatarization from a legacy labor market policy into a powerful engine for building the sustainable, knowledge-based economy envisioned in the Qatar National Vision 2030.

As a cornerstone of the Qatar National Vision 2030, Qatarization aims to build a sustainable, knowledge-based economy by increasing the participation of Qatari citizens in the workforce, particularly in the private and semi-private sectors. Expatriate managers, hired for their specialized expertise, are positioned as the primary agents for the on-the-job development and skill transfer necessary to achieve these national objectives. However, their perceptions of this mentoring mandate are shaped by a complex interplay of professional motivations, psychological pressures, cultural dynamics, and organizational support systems. The analysis reveals a fundamental structural conflict at the heart of the expatriate mentor's role: they are simultaneously tasked with driving immediate business performance based on their unique expertise and transferring that same expertise to a national mentee, which can be perceived as accelerating their own redundancy.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bb38a4920c9b", "text": "ked with driving immediate business performance based on their unique expertise and transferring that same expertise to a national mentee, which can be perceived as accelerating their own redundancy. This tension creates a persistent sense of job insecurity that often leads to a negative perception of the mentoring role and, in some cases, active resistance to knowledge transfer through strategies of \"knowledge hiding.\" This core challenge is compounded by significant cross-cultural barriers. Differing communication styles, concepts of hierarchy and time, and the primacy of relationship- building in Qatari business culture can create friction and misunderstanding within the mentoring dyad.

At the corporate level, strategic human resource management (HRM) must move beyond simply assigning mentors. It requires the implementation of formal, culturally attuned mentorship programs, comprehensive cross-cultural training for expatriates, and, most critically, the alignment of performance management and incentive structures to reward successful mentorship. By making the development of Qatari talent a key performance indicator (KPI) for expatriate managers, organizations can directly mitigate the conflict of interest and repair the psychological contract. At the national level, a rich ecosystem of mentorship initiatives already exists across various sectors. Strengthening public-private partnerships, creating national recognition for successful mentors, and fostering a broader national mentorship culture are essential policy levers. Ultimately, transforming the expatriate manager's perception of their role from a professional threat to a valued and rewarding mandate is the critical variable for unlocking the full potential of mentorship as a tool for achieving the ambitious goals of Qatarization.

This report concludes with a framework of actionable recommendations for policymakers and corporate leaders to build a more effective and sustainable mentorship ecosystem. 1. Introduction: The Expatriate Manager as a Keystone in Workforce Nationalization In the rapidly transforming economic landscape of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), workforce nationalization has emerged as a paramount strategic policy. For the State of Qatar, this initiative, known as \"Qatarization,\" is not merely a labor market adjustment but a foundational element of its long-term developmental blueprint. Within this national project, the expatriate manager occupies a uniquely pivotal and complex position. Recruited for their global expertise and managerial acumen, these individuals are tasked not only with achieving corporate objectives but also with serving as the primary conduits for knowledge transfer and talent development, mentoring the very Qatari professionals intended to eventually assume their roles. This section establishes the strategic context of Qatarization, defines the inherent duality of the expatriate manager's role, and positions mentorship as Page 3 of 26 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team August 24th, 2025 the critical instrument through which the policy's human capital objectives are to be realized.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a63e8dcdb80f", "text": "sitions mentorship as Page 3 of 26 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team August 24th, 2025 the critical instrument through which the policy's human capital objectives are to be realized. 1.1 The Strategic Imperative of Qatarization: Context, Goals, and Progress Qatarization is a government-led strategic initiative designed to increase the number of Qatari citizens employed across public and private sectors, with a stated target of achieving a 50% national workforce in the key Industry and Energy sector.1 This policy is a central pillar of the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030), which aims to transition the nation into an advanced, sustainable, and diversified knowledge-based economy, thereby securing a high standard of living for its people for generations to come.2 The historical roots of Qatarization can be traced back to the Qatari Labor Law No.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1ebc0d7aaed8", "text": "sified knowledge-based economy, thereby securing a high standard of living for its people for generations to come.2 The historical roots of Qatarization can be traced back to the Qatari Labor Law No. 3 of 1962, which stipulated that nationals be given first priority for vacant positions.1 Subsequent decrees, such as the 1997 mandate for at least 20% Qatari employment in private sector businesses, solidified this policy direction.1 The most comprehensive program was launched in 2000, targeting a 50% national workforce in the energy sector by 2005, a goal that proved ambitious, with actual nationalization reaching only 28% by the deadline.1 The current iteration of the policy, as articulated in the Third National Development Strategy (2024-2030), sets a more targeted goal of increasing the share of the Qatari workforce in the private and semi-private sectors from 17% in 2023 to 20% by 2030.3 The drivers behind this sustained policy push are multifaceted. Economically, it seeks to reduce the nation's profound dependence on a vast expatriate workforce.4 With foreign workers representing over 94% of the total labor force, Qatar has one of the highest shares in the world.3 This demographic reality has given rise to significant national security considerations.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_771bdd7cb48a", "text": "ign workers representing over 94% of the total labor force, Qatar has one of the highest shares in the world.3 This demographic reality has given rise to significant national security considerations. As early as 2005, the GCC Secretary-General warned that the \"massive presence of expatriates\" should be viewed \"basically as a national security issue, and not merely as an economic matter\".5 This perspective frames nationalization not just as a matter of employment statistics but as a crucial strategy for ensuring long-term stability and sovereignty. Beyond economic and security concerns, Qatarization is a vital tool for cultural preservation. In a hyper-globalized environment where nationals constitute a small minority of the resident population, the policy is an explicit effort toward \"maintaining Qatar's national identity\".3 The policy, therefore, represents a complex blend of human capital development, economic nationalism, and socio-cultural engineering. It is within this high- stakes context that the expatriate manager is asked to perform their mentoring duties.

They are agents of immediate corporate efficiency and profitability. Simultaneously, the policy of Qatarization imposes a second, equally critical mandate upon them. They are explicitly expected to function as national developers, with a core responsibility for knowledge transfer, training, and mentoring local Qatari talent.6 This creates a fundamental duality in their role. They must deliver short-term results while concurrently building long-term national capacity, often by developing the very individuals who are designated to eventually succeed them.

This dynamic establishes a direct conflict of interest, particularly if the expatriate's continued employment is perceived to be contingent on their unique, non- replicable knowledge. The very act of successful mentorship, of creating a competent and autonomous Qatari successor, can be logically perceived as accelerating one's own redundancy. This is not a matter of individual personality or a lack of goodwill, but a structural paradox embedded within the job description itself. The role simultaneously demands knowledge sharing while implicitly rewarding knowledge hoarding for professional self-preservation. This foundational tension is a primary source of the complex perceptions and challenges that will be explored throughout this report. 1.3 Mentorship as a Critical Instrument for Human Capital Development Page 5 of 26 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team August 24th, 2025 Within the framework of Qatarization, mentorship is not an ancillary activity but is positioned as a central and indispensable instrument for achieving the nation's human capital development goals.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f0f729a0899a", "text": "5 Within the framework of Qatarization, mentorship is not an ancillary activity but is positioned as a central and indispensable instrument for achieving the nation's human capital development goals.

Motivations & Challenges: The Expatriate Mentor's Perspective The success of mentorship as a tool for Qatarization is fundamentally dependent on the perceptions of the expatriate managers tasked with its execution.

When expatriates perceive that the organization's commitment to nationalization policies supersedes its commitment to them, it can lead to feelings of violation, reduced trust, and diminished organizational commitment.15 This is not a singular event but can be experienced as a form of chronic psychological contract breach. An expatriate manager may accept a position based on a set of perceived promises regarding their role, value, and career trajectory within the organization. However, the continuous implementation of Qatarization, the hiring of a national mentee, the announcement of new quotas, the visible fast-tracking of local talent, serves as a constant reminder of the precariousness of their position.

This is not merely an abstract fear but a tangible pressure that directly influences behavior in the workplace. A seminal qualitative study conducted within a Qatari oil and gas company uncovered a stark reality: expatriate \"mentor-coaches,\" in an effort to protect their positions, consciously resisted developing their Qatari mentees.18 They employed subtle techniques to limit the transfer of critical knowledge, effectively transforming the learning environment into a \"site of struggle\" where the mentor's power, derived from their expertise, was in direct conflict with the mentee's need for development.18 This phenomenon is not isolated.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 18, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_98b2f4b1ec2d", "text": "earning environment into a \"site of struggle\" where the mentor's power, derived from their expertise, was in direct conflict with the mentee's need for development.18 This phenomenon is not isolated. Further research on knowledge transfer in both Qatar and Saudi Arabia identified a deliberate \"Deter-Defer-Delay strategy for knowledge hiding\" that was explicitly linked to expatriate job insecurity.19 This strategy involves intentionally withholding or concealing knowledge that has been requested, thereby slowing the mentee's progress and preserving the mentor's status as the indispensable expert. This perception is corroborated by local managers in the neighboring UAE, who report that senior expatriates are often not keen on training nationals and actively try to \"keep locals away to secure their own senior positions\".25 This dilemma places the expatriate manager in a professionally untenable position: to succeed in one aspect of their job (mentoring), they perceive they must risk failure in another (maintaining their employment). 2.2.2 Perceived Skills Gaps and Mutual Stereotyping The effectiveness and enthusiasm of an expatriate mentor are also heavily influenced by their perceptions of the mentee's capabilities, commitment, and work ethic.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_50a00da931c4", "text": "Skills Gaps and Mutual Stereotyping The effectiveness and enthusiasm of an expatriate mentor are also heavily influenced by their perceptions of the mentee's capabilities, commitment, and work ethic.

Research indicates that nationals also stereotype expatriates, often based on nationality, which can lead to social exclusion, a greater perceived cultural distance, and ultimately, poor knowledge transfer.19 This dynamic of mutual stereotyping creates a tense and challenging interpersonal environment.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1015594d9bb6", "text": "d to social exclusion, a greater perceived cultural distance, and ultimately, poor knowledge transfer.19 This dynamic of mutual stereotyping creates a tense and challenging interpersonal environment. According to one study, such tensions were a direct source of reduced self- confidence among Qatari mentees, further poisoning the mentoring relationship and hindering genuine development.18 Breaking down these preconceived notions is a critical, yet difficult, first step for any effective mentorship to begin. 3. Effectiveness of Mentorship: Bridging Gaps in Culture and Competency Evaluating the effectiveness of expatriate-led mentorship under Qatarization requires moving beyond the manager's internal perceptions to assess the tangible outcomes of the mentoring process. The ultimate success of these relationships is measured by their ability to facilitate genuine knowledge transfer, cultivate leadership skills, and bridge the significant gaps in both technical competency and cultural understanding that exist in a highly diverse workforce. This section analyzes the dynamics of cross-cultural knowledge transfer, examines mentorship's role in addressing specific skill shortages, and explores the profound impact of the local socio-cultural context, including the pervasive influence of wasta, on the perceived value and effectiveness of formal development programs. 3.1 The Dynamics of Cross-Cultural Knowledge Transfer At its core, mentorship is a process of knowledge transfer.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a8dbe099764a", "text": "ce of wasta, on the perceived value and effectiveness of formal development programs. 3.1 The Dynamics of Cross-Cultural Knowledge Transfer At its core, mentorship is a process of knowledge transfer. Expatriate managers are viewed by their organizations as crucial vehicles for disseminating critical knowledge, spanning technical expertise, organizational routines, and corporate culture, from global headquarters to the local Qatari workforce.7 However, the path of this knowledge is fraught with cross-cultural complexities. The primary challenge lies in transferring tacit knowledge, the intuitive, experience-based \"know-how\" that is difficult to codify, as opposed to explicit knowledge, which can be easily documented in manuals and procedures. The successful transfer of tacit knowledge depends almost entirely on the quality of the interpersonal relationship between mentor and mentee.

Translating loosely to \"connections\" or \"influence,\" wasta is a deeply embedded socio-cultural practice where personal, familial, and tribal networks are leveraged to secure advantages, including jobs, promotions, and business opportunities.27 Its impact on human resource management is pervasive, often creating a parallel system of career advancement that operates independently of, and sometimes in direct opposition to, formal meritocratic processes.28 This presents a formidable challenge to the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of formal mentorship programs. The entire premise of mentorship as a corporate HR intervention rests on the principles of meritocracy: that developing one's skills and competencies is the primary path to career success. Wasta, however, offers an alternative path where advancement is contingent on social capital rather than demonstrated performance.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d8fe677bdd74", "text": "one's skills and competencies is the primary path to career success.

This dynamic can actively delegitimize the mentorship process in the eyes of both the mentor and the mentee. For the expatriate manager, who is typically an outsider to the dense local networks where wasta operates 28, the mentoring role can begin to feel performative and futile. They may invest significant time and effort in developing a mentee's skills, only to see career-defining opportunities awarded to others based on connections. This can lead to the perception that their developmental work is ultimately irrelevant to the mentee's actual career trajectory. For the Qatari mentee, the incentive to fully engage in a demanding, skills-based development program may be diminished if they believe that cultivating their social network is a more reliable and efficient strategy for advancement. When an employee observes that promotions and desirable assignments are more effectively secured through who they know rather than what they know, the perceived value of the mentorship relationship plummets. In this way, wasta does not merely compete with formal mentorship; it has the potential to undermine its very foundation, shifting the perceived locus of control for career success away from individual development and toward network cultivation.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 29, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f0b6d02a5dda", "text": "h formal mentorship; it has the potential to undermine its very foundation, shifting the perceived locus of control for career success away from individual development and toward network cultivation.

Feedback & Policy: A Framework for an Enhanced Mentorship Ecosystem The complex perceptions and challenges faced by expatriate managers in their mentoring roles are not insurmountable. They can be significantly mitigated through a concerted and multi-layered approach involving strategic interventions at both the corporate and governmental levels. Creating an environment where mentorship is perceived as a rewarding and effective activity requires building a robust ecosystem of support. This involves strengthening the corporate scaffolding through strategic human resource management (HRM) and leveraging governmental and institutional influence to foster a national culture that values and promotes mentorship. 4.1 Strengthening the Corporate Scaffolding: The Role of Strategic HRM The primary responsibility for creating a successful mentorship environment lies with the individual organizations employing expatriate managers and Qatari nationals.

The literature clearly indicates that ad-hoc, informal approaches are insufficient. Success is contingent on deliberate, structured, and well-supported corporate programs.7 Strategic HRM has a critical role to play in designing and implementing the necessary frameworks to facilitate effective mentorship.22 Leading companies in Qatar, particularly within the energy sector, have already demonstrated a commitment to this approach. Firms such as QAPCO, North Oil Company (NOC), and QatarEnergy LNG have established comprehensive national development programs that formally integrate mentoring and coaching as core components of talent development.12 Shell Qatar explicitly states that achieving Qatarization goals requires the dedicated support of experienced expatriate staff to provide on-the-job coaching and mentoring.31 These examples provide a model for broader implementation across other sectors. 4.1.1 Designing and Implementing Formal, Culturally-Attuned Mentorship Programs To be effective, mentorship cannot be an afterthought; it must be institutionalized.

A wide range of corporate training providers offer specialized programs for expatriates in Qatar that focus on precisely the skills needed for effective mentorship.32 A typical curriculum should cover: \u25cf Foundations of Qatari Culture: Including the role of Islamic tradition, family and community solidarity, and common values and behavioral patterns. \u25cf The Qatari Corporate World: Understanding hierarchy, the importance of intermediaries and networking, and communication styles (both verbal and non- verbal).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b5f61dd4fda1", "text": "common values and behavioral patterns. \u25cf The Qatari Corporate World: Understanding hierarchy, the importance of intermediaries and networking, and communication styles (both verbal and non- verbal). \u25cf Effective Management Techniques: Focusing on prudence, active listening, providing feedback in a culturally sensitive manner, and encouraging initiative. \u25cf Navigating Social Norms: Including an awareness of sensitive topics and practices like wasta. By equipping expatriate managers with this cultural toolkit, organizations can significantly reduce the stress and misunderstanding that often derail mentoring relationships, allowing them to focus on the substantive work of skills development. Page 16 of 26 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team August 24th, 2025 4.1.3 Aligning Incentives and Performance Management with Mentoring Objectives Perhaps the most powerful lever available to corporations is the alignment of their performance management and reward systems with Qatarization objectives. The core conflict driving negative perceptions of mentoring is the structural paradox where developing a successor is perceived as a threat to one's own career. This conflict can be directly resolved by fundamentally altering the incentive structure. The most critical policy change an organization can implement is to formally and transparently integrate the successful development of Qatari mentees into the key performance indicators (KPIs) of expatriate managers.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 34, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d2220b513914", "text": "policy change an organization can implement is to formally and transparently integrate the successful development of Qatari mentees into the key performance indicators (KPIs) of expatriate managers.

The task is no longer a peripheral, risky obligation but a central driver of their own professional success. This transformation realigns the psychological contract, turning the Qatari mentee from a perceived replacement into a key project critical to the mentor's own advancement. This single strategic move addresses the job security dilemma at its root and changes the fundamental perception of the mentoring role from a threat to a vital opportunity. 4.2 Governmental and Institutional Levers for Change While corporations hold the primary responsibility for implementing effective mentorship programs, the Qatari government and its affiliated institutions play an indispensable role in creating a national ecosystem that encourages, supports, and rewards these efforts.

This would create a powerful non-financial incentive that directly rewards excellence in mentoring. 4.2.2 Policy Recommendations for Fostering a National Mentorship Culture Beyond specific programs, the government can shape the national conversation around talent development. This can be achieved by launching public awareness campaigns that celebrate success stories of mentorship under Qatarization, highlighting both the Qatari professionals who have risen to leadership roles and the expatriate mentors who guided them.

Conclusion: Synthesizing Perceptions and Charting a Path Forward The perception of the expatriate manager is the critical, and often overlooked, variable in the success of mentorship as a cornerstone of Qatar's nationalization strategy. This analysis of the available literature reveals that this perception is not arbitrary but is the logical outcome of a series of structural, psychological, and cultural pressures. The expatriate manager's role is defined by a central paradox: a mandate to develop local talent that often conflicts with the rational instinct for professional self-preservation. This fundamental tension, if left unaddressed, fosters an environment where mentorship is viewed as a threat, knowledge transfer is inhibited, and the full potential of Qatar's human capital remains unrealized.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-08-24", "series_number": 9, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 39, "total_chunks": 50, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_2-Q9_ EN_2025-08-24.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-08-24", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f08d45a3ce66", "text": "ental tension, if left unaddressed, fosters an environment where mentorship is viewed as a threat, knowledge transfer is inhibited, and the full potential of Qatar's human capital remains unrealized. The challenges are compounded by a complex cultural milieu. The subtle yet powerful dynamics of high-context communication, differing views on hierarchy, and the primacy of relational trust demand a high level of intercultural competence that many expatriates are not adequately prepared for. The parallel system of career advancement through wasta further complicates the landscape, creating the potential to delegitimize formal, merit- based development programs and breed cynicism among both mentors and mentees. However, these challenges are not intractable. Charting a path forward requires a deliberate and dual approach that addresses the root causes of negative perceptions. At the corporate level, organizations must move beyond the passive assignment of mentors and build a robust strategic framework. This framework must include formal, culturally-attuned programs, mandatory and rigorous cross-cultural training, and, most critically, a realignment of performance management systems to explicitly and substantially reward successful mentorship.

By integrating corporate programs with national leadership initiatives and creating prestigious forms of recognition for both companies and individual mentors, the state can elevate the status of this crucial developmental activity. Ultimately, the success of Qatarization hinges on transforming the expatriate manager from a temporary holder of expertise into an incentivized and empowered agent of national development.

Introduction: A Paradigm Shift in Labour Governance 1.1 The Imperative for Reform: The Pre-Kafala System For decades, Qatar\u2019s labour market was governed by the sponsorship (kafala) system, a framework common throughout the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that structured and controlled labour migration (ILO Regional OVice for Arab States 2017).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_82986a88dce5", "text": "the sponsorship (kafala) system, a framework common throughout the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that structured and controlled labour migration (ILO Regional OVice for Arab States 2017). In its modern form, Page 2 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 which emerged in the mid-20th century, the kafala system was a means to regulate the entry and residence of the migrant workers needed to fuel the nation\u2019s ambitious development goals. The system was legally founded on Qatar\u2019s Sponsorship Law (Law No. 4 of 2009) and Labour Law (Law No. 14 of 2004), which together tied a migrant worker\u2019s legal status (State of Qatar 2009; State of Qatar 2004), including their right to reside in the country, change jobs, or leave, to a single employer or \u201csponsor\u201d (kafeel) (Jureidini 2017; Gardner, Pessoa, and Harkness 2014; Regueiro 2020). This framework created a significant power imbalance that constrained two fundamental liberties: freedom of contract (the ability to terminate employment and seek new opportunities) and freedom of movement (the ability to leave the country). 1.1.1 Origins and Structure: Historical and Legal Foundations The term kafala originates from the Arabic root k-f-l, which includes the meanings \u201cto vouch for\u201d or \u201cto be a legal guardian\u201d (AlShehabi 2019). While the concept has roots in legal practice, its application to migrant labour in the Gulf is a modern construct.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f8a65427f644", "text": "includes the meanings \u201cto vouch for\u201d or \u201cto be a legal guardian\u201d (AlShehabi 2019). While the concept has roots in legal practice, its application to migrant labour in the Gulf is a modern construct. This system was developed to manage a massive influx of foreign labour required to meet ambitious development goals; by 2015, foreign nationals constituted up to 95 percent of the entire employed population in Qatar (De Bel-Air 2017). Historical analysis shows that the system did not originate from ancient Bedouin customs, but rather from bureaucratic procedures developed during the British colonial era (c. 1920s-1970s) to control the flow of migrant labour, first in the pearling industry and later expanding with the advent of the oil sector (AlShehabi 2019). Following independence, the authority to sponsor foreign workers was restricted and delegated to citizens and citizen-owned companies (AlShehabi 2019). This eVectively transferred regulatory authority over labour migration from the state to its citizenry, placing citizens at the center of a system of privilege and power (Babar 2015). The sponsor, or kafeel, became legally responsible for the sponsored migrant worker, whose legal status to enter, reside, and work in the country became entirely dependent on that sponsor (AlShehabi 2019; Regueiro 2020). This structure created a profoundly unequal relationship that rendered workers highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse (Babar 2015; Cr\u00e9peau 2014).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ff5f8635e43a", "text": "on that sponsor (AlShehabi 2019; Regueiro 2020). This structure created a profoundly unequal relationship that rendered workers highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse (Babar 2015; Cr\u00e9peau 2014). 1.1.2 Control Mechanisms: Key Instruments The primary instruments of this control were the legal requirements for a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to change employers and an exit permit to depart Qatar. \u2022 No-Objection Certificate (NOC): Under the pre-reform system, a migrant worker could not legally change employers without first obtaining an NOC from their current sponsor. This permission was granted entirely at the sponsor\u2019s discretion (ILO Regional OVice for Arab States 2017). Without this certificate, the worker faced a two-year ban on re-entering the country for new employment after their contract ended (Gardner, Pessoa, and Harkness 2014). \u2022 Exit Permit: The Sponsorship Law mandated that most migrant workers secure an exit permit from their sponsor to leave Qatar, whether temporarily or permanently (Jureidini 2017; Cr\u00e9peau, 2014). This requirement was largely removed by legal changes on September 4, 2018, and January 16, 2020, which extended the right to exit without a permit to nearly all categories of workers (ILO 2020b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_aea9d15205f8", "text": ").

Page 3 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 1.1.3 Worker Experience: The Pre-Reform System The legal structure of the kafala system produced a range of adverse outcomes for migrant workers, which were widely documented by researchers and human rights organizations. One of the most common illegal practices was passport confiscation. In a 2012 survey of low-income migrants in Qatar, later published by Gardner et al. (2013), 90% of respondents reported that their employer possessed their passport. Although illegal, this practice was widespread and served to further restrict workers\u2019 freedom of movement and their ability to abscond from an abusive situation (Gardner, Pessoa, and Harkness 2014). This system also facilitated financial exploitation. The high demand for jobs in Qatar led to a system where prospective migrants paid substantial recruitment fees in their home countries to secure employment (R. R. Jureidini, n.d.). One study found that 71% of low-income migrants had paid an average of US$1,031 for the right to work in Qatar (Gardner et al. 2013). Many workers and their families took on significant debt to cover these costs, meaning they often spent their first year or more in Qatar simply repaying these loans.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_7d955d4d3cb9", "text": "in Qatar (Gardner et al. 2013). Many workers and their families took on significant debt to cover these costs, meaning they often spent their first year or more in Qatar simply repaying these loans. This debt bondage created a coercive dynamic that undermined a worker\u2019s practical ability to leave an exploitative job (Pessoa, Harkness, and Gardner 2014). Furthermore, salary abuse was a common grievance. The same 2012 survey revealed that 21% of low-income workers reported receiving their salary \u201conly sometimes, rarely, or never\u201d (Gardner et al. 2013). The diViculty in changing employers, institutionalized by the NOC requirement, meant that workers had little leverage to challenge delayed wages or contract substitutions, where the salary upon arrival was lower than what was promised in the home country. For many workers, the non-payment of promised wages was the primary factor that compelled them to seek redress through the justice system (Gardner, Pessoa, and Harkness 2014). The domestic worker population faced particular vulnerabilities. As they are typically excluded from the protections of national labour laws, domestic workers had even fewer avenues for seeking assistance (Murray 2012). Their isolation within private households made them acutely dependent on their sponsors and susceptible to abuses with limited recourse (Gardner, Pessoa, and Harkness, 2014).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9f983e7d0d8c", "text": "ssistance (Murray 2012). Their isolation within private households made them acutely dependent on their sponsors and susceptible to abuses with limited recourse (Gardner, Pessoa, and Harkness, 2014). The combination of these legal and practical constraints underscored the urgent need for comprehensive reform of Qatar\u2019s labour governance system. 1.2 Strategic Enablers: A Wave of Legislative and Administrative Change Beginning in 2018 and accelerating significantly in 2020, Qatar initiated a series of historic legal and administrative reforms designed to dismantle the most restrictive elements of the kafala system. This wave of change was not spontaneous but was enabled by a combination of international scrutiny and a strategic partnership with key international bodies, most notably the International Labour Organization (ILO). Furthermore, these reforms are increasingly understood as crucial components of Qatar\u2019s long-term economic and social development strategy, aimed at creating a more competitive and diversified economy. 1.2.1 The Catalyst for Change: International Scrutiny and ILO Cooperation The awarding of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar placed its labour laws under intense international scrutiny. A range of actors, including media outlets and international organizations, critiqued the country\u2019s human rights record and advocated for legal reform (Calo 2023; Regueiro Page 4 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a07a2e336c49", "text": "rganizations, critiqued the country\u2019s human rights record and advocated for legal reform (Calo 2023; Regueiro Page 4 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 2020). While the reforms were not a contractual obligation for hosting the tournament, the event served as a powerful catalyst for change (Calo 2023). This pressure culminated in a formal complaint lodged against Qatar with the ILO in 2014 by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (BWI). The complaint alleged non-compliance with international obligations regarding forced labour and labour inspection, citing the power imbalance created by the kafala system (ILO 2016; Jeremia\u0161ov\u00e1 2021). This initiated a multi-year supervisory process that ultimately led to a significant breakthrough. In November 2017, the ILO Governing Body closed the complaint, endorsing the launch of a comprehensive three-year technical cooperation program with the Qatari government (ILO 2017). This agreement marked a pivotal shift from an adversarial process to a collaborative partnership aimed at fundamentally transforming Qatar\u2019s labour market. A key outcome of this accord was the inauguration of an ILO Project OVice in Doha in April 2018, creating an institutional anchor for providing technical assistance and monitoring the implementation of reforms (ILO 2019b; Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_711845e49a4e", "text": "April 2018, creating an institutional anchor for providing technical assistance and monitoring the implementation of reforms (ILO 2019b; Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) 2025). 1.2.2 Legislative Agenda: A Landmark Overhaul The technical cooperation with the ILO provided the framework and impetus for a rapid and ambitious legislative agenda between 2018 and 2021 (ESCWA 2025; World Bank 2021). Between 2018 and 2021, reforms followed three pillars: (1) exit permits, (2) job mobility/NOC, and (3) wage floor and enforcement. The government, in partnership with the ILO, began systematically dismantling the legal pillars of the kafala system that constrained workers\u2019 freedom of contract and movement. This legislative push was seen by observers as a significant step toward rectifying the structural issues that facilitated exploitation (Jeremia\u0161ov\u00e1 2021). This agenda included several landmark pieces of legislation. Law No. 13 of 2018 represented a critical first step by formally ending the exit permit requirement for most workers covered under the Labour Law (State of Qatar 2018). This was followed by a series of ministerial decrees, such as Ministerial Decision No. 95 of 2019, that extended this right to nearly all remaining categories of workers, including those in ministries and the oil and gas sector, fundamentally altering the power dynamic between employer and employee (Bartoszewicz and Lang 2024; State of Qatar 2020b; Ministry of Labour (MoL) 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c6edf1760811", "text": "ose in ministries and the oil and gas sector, fundamentally altering the power dynamic between employer and employee (Bartoszewicz and Lang 2024; State of Qatar 2020b; Ministry of Labour (MoL) 2021). The cornerstone of the reforms came with Decree-Law No. 19 of 2020, which oVicially abolished the No-Objection Certificate (NOC) requirement, thereby allowing workers to change employers without their sponsor\u2019s permission (State of Qatar 2020d; MoL 2021; Zahra 2014). In parallel, Law No. 17 of 2020 established the region\u2019s first non-discriminatory minimum wage, which was later detailed in Decision of the Minister of Administrative Development, Labour and Social AVairs No. (25) of 2020. This decision set a minimum basic wage and mandated allowances for food and housing, creating a wage floor for all workers, including those in domestic service (State of Qatar 2020a; Minister of Administrative Development, Labor and Social AVairs (MADLSA) 2020). These legislative changes collectively represent one of the most significant labour governance transformations in the region, directly addressing the core question of how legal reforms can enhance worker freedoms (ILO 2022b).

The Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) outlines a roadmap for transitioning from a hydrocarbon-based economy to a diversified, knowledge-based one (General Secretariat for Development Planning (GSDP) 2008). This strategic vision necessitates a more dynamic and competitive labour market, which the traditional kafala system, with its inherent restrictions on labour mobility, actively hindered (Kagan and Cholewinski 2022). The kafala system was increasingly recognized as creating labour market ineViciencies. By tying workers to a single employer, it suppressed wages, discouraged skills development, and led to a practice of \u201clabour hoarding,\u201d where employers would keep more workers than necessary (Kagan and Cholewinski 2022). The reforms, therefore, are also an economic imperative. Allowing workers to change jobs introduces competition among employers, incentivizing them to oVer better wages and working conditions to attract and retain talent. This increased labour mobility allows for a more eVicient allocation of skills across the economy, which is crucial for fostering productivity and innovation (Kagan and Cholewinski 2022; ESCWA 2025).

Consequently, the reforms are not just a human rights issue but a strategic adjustment to meet the demands of a modern, globalized economy. While significant legal changes have been enacted, the \u201cunfinished business\u201d of reform remains, particularly in ensuring that these new laws translate into meaningful, everyday freedom for all workers (Kagan and Cholewinski 2022; Jeremia\u0161ov\u00e1 2021). 1.3 The Core Policy Question: Gauging On-the-Ground Impact This report provides an extended analysis of Qatar\u2019s recent labour reforms, examining both the changes in law (\u201claw-on-the-books\u201d) and their practical, on-the-ground implementation and outcomes (\u201claw-in-action\u201d) for the migrant workforce between 2018 and 2025. The landmark legislative agenda, undertaken in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), has systematically dismantled the legal pillars of the Kafala system that historically constrained workers\u2019 freedom of contract and movement (ESCWA, 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 15, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f52d116c8863", "text": "he International Labour Organization (ILO), has systematically dismantled the legal pillars of the Kafala system that historically constrained workers\u2019 freedom of contract and movement (ESCWA, 2025). However, the central aim of this report is not simply to document these legal changes, but to investigate their tangible eVect on workers\u2019 lives. 1.3.1 Central Framework: Law-on-the-Books versus Law-in-Action A critical distinction must be made between the law as it is written and the law as it is experienced. While Qatar has instituted a broad suite of significant legal reforms, questions remain about whether these new legal norms have translated into enforceable rights and improved access to justice for migrant workers (Calo 2023). Many observers have noted a persistent gap between the reformed laws and the reality on the ground, where many of the new rights are reported to exist only on paper (Calo 2023; Hawkes et al. 2023). Therefore, a core challenge is to assess the \u201claw-in-action,\u201d which means the practical eVects of these reforms on the everyday freedoms of workers. This involves analyzing the extent to which Page 6 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 legislative changes have overcome the deeply embedded power imbalances and structural features that defined the pre-reform Kafala system (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 16, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e854171ac09a", "text": "Research Team October 14th, 2025 legislative changes have overcome the deeply embedded power imbalances and structural features that defined the pre-reform Kafala system (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024). 1.3.2 Core Challenge: Implementation and Enforcement Despite the formal abolition of key control mechanisms, researchers and international bodies continue to document significant hurdles that prevent the full realization of worker freedoms. Structural problems concerning imbalances of power and the way dispute resolution is conducted remain deeply rooted (Calo 2023). Key implementation challenges that illustrate this gap include: (a) Employer Retaliation: Workers who attempt to exercise their new right to change jobs still face retaliatory actions from employers, such as the cancellation of residency permits or the filing of false \u201cabsconding\u201d charges (ILO 2024b). (b) De Facto Requirements: Although the legal requirement for a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to change employers has been abolished, a de facto NOC, such as a signed resignation letter, is often still required in practice for many job applications (ILO 2024b; Kalush and Saraswathi 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1b94e2216d42", "text": "OC) to change employers has been abolished, a de facto NOC, such as a signed resignation letter, is often still required in practice for many job applications (ILO 2024b; Kalush and Saraswathi 2024). (c) Dispute Resolution Deficiencies: While new Labour Dispute Settlement Committees have been established, workers continue to face significant diViculties with enforcement, including long delays in holding hearings and problems with enforcing judgments, which undermines the eVectiveness of the system as a mechanism for legal redress (Calo 2023). These persistent issues underscore that legislative reform alone is insuVicient. The eVectiveness of the new laws is contingent on robust and transparent enforcement, the capacity of state institutions, and the degree to which reforms can alter the conduct of employers and the profoundly unequal relationship that has long characterized the labour market (Babar and Vora 2022; Calo 2023). This report, therefore, moves beyond a simple review of new laws to ask a more fundamental question: to what extent have these legislative changes translated into a tangible, everyday reality of greater freedom for workers? 1.4 The Social Context: Attitudes of the National Population The long-term success of labour reforms also depends on their social legitimacy within the host population.

The study highlights a dual perspective among Qataris: a strong majority acknowledges the vital economic contributions of migrant workers, yet concerns about demographic balance and infrastructure strain persist, with 41% of citizens favoring a decrease in new foreign workers. Crucially, however, the research reveals a significant generational shift. Younger Qataris (aged 18- 44) were found to be significantly more supportive of increasing the number of high-skilled workers compared to the older generation. This suggests that as a new generation enters the workforce and civic life, social acceptance of a diverse and dynamic labour market is likely to strengthen.

The legislative process to dismantle this barrier was notable for its phased approach, beginning with a broad reform and later extending protections to previously excluded worker categories. 2.1.1 Legislative Process: A Phased Abolition The first major step in this reform was the passage of Law No. 13 of 2018, which amended the existing Law No. 21 of 2015 regulating the entry and exit of expatriates (State of Qatar 2018). This new legislation formally granted the majority of migrant workers covered under the Labour Law the right to leave Qatar, either temporarily or permanently, without first needing to secure an exit permit from their employer (Jeremia\u0161ov\u00e1 2021). The law aimed to significantly reduce employer control over workers\u2019 ability to depart the country. However, the 2018 law was not comprehensive. It explicitly excluded large categories of workers not covered by the Labour Law, including domestic workers, public sector employees, workers in the oil and gas industry, and those employed in agriculture and at sea (Human Rights Watch 2018; ILO 2020a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_35e1bf972476", "text": "covered by the Labour Law, including domestic workers, public sector employees, workers in the oil and gas industry, and those employed in agriculture and at sea (Human Rights Watch 2018; ILO 2020a). Furthermore, the law introduced a provision allowing employers to designate up to 5% of their workforce as essential, thereby requiring those individuals to still obtain prior permission to leave due to the nature of their work (State of Qatar 2018; Regueiro 2020). Recognizing these gaps, the second phase of the reform came with Ministerial Decision No. 95 of 2019, which came into force on January 16, 2020 (Minister of Interior 2019). This decision extended the right to exit without a permit to almost all of the previously excluded categories of workers (ILO 2020a).

As detailed in Section 3.2.4, discussions within Qatar\u2019s advisory Shura Council in June-July 2024 considered measures to reinstate an employer permission requirement for domestic workers seeking to leave the country (Page 2024). While the proposal was not enacted as of early 2025, the discussion itself created significant uncertainty and highlighted the risk of policy backsliding on critical labour reforms. 2.2 Unlocking Labour Mobility: The Abolition of the NOC The single most important reform for enhancing workers\u2019 freedom of contract was the removal of the employer\u2019s right to prevent a worker from changing jobs.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 22, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8258d28a2aef", "text": "g Labour Mobility: The Abolition of the NOC The single most important reform for enhancing workers\u2019 freedom of contract was the removal of the employer\u2019s right to prevent a worker from changing jobs. This was achieved by dismantling the legal requirement for a No-Objection Certificate (NOC), a key pillar of control in the pre- reform Kafala system which tied a worker\u2019s ability to move to a new job to their current employer\u2019s consent (Human Rights Watch 2020; Zahra 2014). 2.2.1 Legislative Cornerstone: Abolishing the NOC Requirement The cornerstone of the mobility reforms was Decree-Law No. 19 of 2020, which amended key provisions of Law No. 21 of 2015 on the entry, exit, and residence of expatriates. This new legislation formally abolished the legal requirement for migrant workers to obtain an NOC from their employer before changing jobs (State of Qatar 2020c; Human Rights Watch 2020). The reform was a landmark step, establishing for the first time in the region that workers could change employers at any point during their contract, subject only to a set of procedural requirements managed by the state rather than their employer (ILO 2022a).

The process is managed through the Ministry of Labour\u2019s electronic platform, a centralized digital system where workers or their new employers can submit a request to change employment (MoL n.d.-a). The procedure requires the worker to observe a statutory notice period, which is one month if they have worked for the current employer for two years or less, and two months if they have worked for more than two years (Human Rights Watch 2020). Once the notice period is complete and the application is approved, the new employer must use the Ministry\u2019s Digital Authentication System to process a new multi-lingual employment contract. To further streamline this process, the Ministry of Labour launched a revised electronic platform for ECs in May 2024, which allows both workers and new employers to initiate the application and no longer requires the submission of paper forms (see Section 4.2.2) (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025 (Ministry of Labour administrative data shared with ILO)).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 24, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1a3554b04659", "text": "iate the application and no longer requires the submission of paper forms (see Section 4.2.2) (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025 (Ministry of Labour administrative data shared with ILO)). 2.2.3 Law in Action: Uptake and System Performance The uptake of the new system has been substantial, demonstrating that the reforms addressed a significant need within the labour force. Between the introduction of the reforms in September 2020 and October 2023, the Ministry of Labour processed 1,037,644 EC applications. Of these, Page 9 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 669,198 applications were approved (approximately 64%) and 364,053 were rejected (approximately 36%) (ILO 2024a). This high volume illustrates a fundamental shift in labour market dynamics. This progress is also reflected in data for domestic workers, a historically more restricted group; in 2024 alone, there were 3,399 approved EC applications from this group (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). 2.2.4 Persistent Challenges: The \u2018De Facto\u2019 NOC Despite the formal abolition of the NOC, significant hurdles to labour mobility persist.

A primary challenge is the emergence of \u201cde facto\u201d NOC requirements, where new employers, despite the legal change, still request a signed resignation letter or similar document from a worker\u2019s previous sponsor as a condition of employment (ILO 2024a; Kalush and Saraswathi 2024). A 2024 study by the ILO and the Ministry of Labour found that a significant majority of employers still ask for NOCs or equivalent documents when recruiting workers locally. Employers cited reasons such as mitigating potential delays in the oVicial transfer process and avoiding conflicts with the former employer (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). Furthermore, workers who try to exercise their right to change jobs still face retaliatory actions from employers, such as the cancellation of residency permits or the filing of false \u201cabsconding\u201d charges, which can deter workers from pursuing new opportunities (ILO 2022a; ILO 2024a).

These two pillars, the non- discriminatory minimum wage and the Wage Protection System, work in tandem to create a more transparent and equitable wage environment. 2.3.1 Minimum Wage: A Non-Discriminatory Standard A landmark development in Qatar\u2019s labour reforms was the adoption of Law No. 17 of 2020, which established the region\u2019s first non-discriminatory minimum wage (State of Qatar 2020a). This legislation set a universal wage floor applicable to all workers in all sectors, including domestic workers, regardless of their nationality. The specifics of the wage were outlined in the subsequent Ministerial Decision No. (25) of 2020 (MADLSA 2020). EVective March 20, 2021, the decision mandated a minimum basic monthly wage of QAR 1,000 (Hatayama 2022). Furthermore, it stipulated that employers must also provide either decent accommodation and food, or, alternatively, monthly allowances of at least QAR 500 for housing and QAR 300 for food (MADLSA 2020).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f5bbaea0afc8", "text": "hermore, it stipulated that employers must also provide either decent accommodation and food, or, alternatively, monthly allowances of at least QAR 500 for housing and QAR 300 for food (MADLSA 2020). The introduction of this wage floor had a significant and immediate impact; an estimated 280,000 workers, representing 13% of the private sector workforce, saw their basic wage increase to meet the new threshold (ILO 2022a). The law also established a Minimum Wage Committee to periodically review the wage level, ensuring its continued relevance to economic conditions and the cost of living (State of Qatar 2020a). Page 10 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 2.3.2 Wage Protection: The WPS Enforcement Mechanism The minimum wage framework is supported and enforced by the pre-existing Wage Protection System (WPS), an electronic salary transfer system established in 2015 to monitor and document wage payments (Jureidini 2018; ILO 2019a). As mandated by Ministerial Decision No. (4) of 2015, all employers are required to transfer workers\u2019 wages through Qatari banks within seven days of their due date (Minister of Labor and Social AVairs 2015). This process makes wage payments fully traceable by the Ministry of Labour (ILO 2020c). The system functions through a monthly Salary Information File (SIF) that employers must submit to their bank, detailing each worker\u2019s basic salary, allowances, and any deductions (ILO 2019a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1ef573150c3d", "text": "020c). The system functions through a monthly Salary Information File (SIF) that employers must submit to their bank, detailing each worker\u2019s basic salary, allowances, and any deductions (ILO 2019a). The WPS has achieved extensive coverage, with reports indicating that more than 1.66 million workers (96% of the eligible workforce) are registered (MoL 2021; ILO 2020c). Following the introduction of the minimum wage, the WPS was upgraded to better detect violations, including payments below the new minimum threshold and to ensure greater transparency by adding specific data fields for food and housing allowances (ILO 2020c). Non-compliance with the WPS can result in penalties, including the suspension of an employer\u2019s ability to obtain new work permits, a sanction that employers perceive as commercially serious (Minister of Labor and Social AVairs 2015). 2.4 Systemic Enablers: Dispute Resolution and Digitalization Qatar has paired legal reforms with systems intended to make those rights usable: (1) faster dispute channels, (2) guaranteed wage recovery, and (3) digitalization of core processes. Recognizing that legal reforms are only meaningful if they can be enforced, Qatar has bolstered its remedy mechanisms and administrative eViciency through several systemic enablers.

Mandated by Law No. 13 of 2017, these committees created a new, specialized bipartite dispute resolution process designed to be more accessible and eVicient than the traditional court system (Legal and Judicial Studies Center, Ministry of Justice 2018; Calo 2023). It involves a two-step process: first, a mandatory mediation at the Ministry of Labour aimed at an amicable settlement, and second, if mediation fails, the case is referred to the LDSCs for a binding legal judgment. The committees have jurisdiction over disputes arising from the Labour Law and employment contracts, including issues of unpaid wages, job duties, and working hours (Legal and Judicial Studies Center, Ministry of Justice 2018; Calo 2023). To improve accessibility for migrant workers, committees were established in several locations, including the industrial area where many workers reside (Calo 2023). The number of committees was increased from three to five in November 2022 to handle the caseload (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 30, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5c6ef3ccf542", "text": "dustrial area where many workers reside (Calo 2023).

The Fund\u2019s primary purpose is to ensure workers receive due compensation when employers default on wage payments following a final judgment from a Labour Dispute Settlement Committee (ILO 2019c). In such cases, the Fund pays the workers\u2019 entitlements and then seeks to recover the amount from the employer. Public reports indicate that the WSIF has disbursed significant amounts since its inception. By August 2023, the total amount paid to workers from the Fund had increased substantially to approximately QAR 2.3 billion (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2023).

Page 12 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 2.4.3 Digitalization: Streamlining Labour Services The process for all these reforms has been increasingly digitalized, with e-contracting, online mobility applications, and digital identity verification intended to lower transaction costs, reduce forgery, and standardize timelines (Elidrisy 2024). This push aligns with Qatar\u2019s broader national strategy of digital transformation (Asmyatullin and Glavina 2025; Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) 2024). A key digital tool is the Ministry of Labour\u2019s electronic platform for processing ECs. A revised version launched in May 2024 allows both workers and new employers to initiate the application, notifying the other party for approval, which eliminates the need for paper forms and streamlines the process (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025; MoL 2024a).

Evidence of Practical Uptake: How Workers Are Using the New Rights in Practice (2020\u20132025) 3.1 Gauging System Uptake: Job Mobility and Processing Data The ultimate test of these reforms lies in their uptake by the workforce and the e7iciency of the systems designed to implement them.

Data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and academic surveys provide critical insights into the scale of this change. 3.1.1 System Uptake: Scale and Growth of Labour Mobility The introduction of policies to dismantle the kafala system facilitated a huge increase in labour mobility. Prior to the reforms, job mobility was extremely limited, with approximately 9,000 and 18,000 workers changing jobs in 2018 and 2019, respectively (ILO 2022a). Following the legal changes, the uptake was immediate and substantial. In the first year of the reforms alone (September 2020 to August 2021), EC approvals increased by approximately 830% compared to the year before the reforms (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). This high volume has been sustained, demonstrating that the reforms address a significant need within the labour force. Between September 2020 and October 2023, the Ministry of Labour (MoL) processed 1,037,644 EC applications. Of these, 669,198 were approved (an approval rate of approximately 64%) and 364,053 were rejected (\u224836%), demonstrating a high and continuous volume of use (ILO 2024a). The trend continued through 2024, with an additional 60,251 EC Page 13 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 applications approved for men and women through the end of September 2024 (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 35, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_61067c6413d3", "text": "of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 applications approved for men and women through the end of September 2024 (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025).

A 2021 survey of low-wage migrant workers confirmed this trend from the workers\u2019 perspective, finding that 27% had already changed their employer since arriving in Qatar (Ewers et al. 2023; Diop et al. 2021). 3.1.2 System Performance: Administrative Processing and EPiciency The performance of the administrative system for processing ECs has improved dramatically since its inception.

The significance of this inclusion is underscored by the sheer size of the domestic worker population. Page 14 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 3.2.1 Demographics: A Snapshot of Domestic Workers According to data from Qatar\u2019s National Planning Council (NPC), the domestic worker sector comprises 167,264 individuals, all of whom are non-Qatari (NPC 2025). This workforce is gendered, with women making up the majority at 101,069 (approximately 60.4%), while men number 66,195 (approximately 39.6%) (NPC 2025). This substantial population was historically excluded from the main Labour Law (Law No. 14 of 2004) and was instead covered by the less comprehensive Law No. (15) of 2017 on Domestic Workers (Mahasneh 2022). This separate legal framework established basic protections but lacked the scope of the general labour law, particularly regarding overtime pay and sick leave (Mahasneh 2022; State of Qatar 2017).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 38, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0ced833d812d", "text": "). This separate legal framework established basic protections but lacked the scope of the general labour law, particularly regarding overtime pay and sick leave (Mahasneh 2022; State of Qatar 2017). The inclusion of this group in the recent wave of major reforms, therefore, represents a significant step towards dismantling a tiered system of rights. 3.2.2 Legal Inclusion: Landmark Mobility Reforms A pivotal development was the extension of the \u201cNo-Objection Certificate\u201d (NOC) abolition to domestic workers, granting them the same right as other private-sector workers to change employers (MoL n.d.-a). This move directly addresses one of the primary drivers of vulnerability by allowing workers to leave an abusive or exploitative employment situation without their employer\u2019s consent. Similarly, the right to exit the country without a permit was extended to domestic workers in January 2020, removing another key instrument of control previously held by employers (ILO 2020b). 3.2.3 Law in Action: Uptake and Impact on Mobility The data shows a steady and significant increase in the uptake of these new freedoms by domestic workers. In the first year of the reforms (October 2020 to October 2021), 3,674 domestic workers successfully changed jobs (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2021). By September 2023, the cumulative number of approved EC applications for domestic workers had reached 10,827 (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 39, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8749abfb1222", "text": "oject OVice for the State of Qatar 2021). By September 2023, the cumulative number of approved EC applications for domestic workers had reached 10,827 (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2023). This momentum has continued, with an additional 3,399 approved EC applications from domestic workers in 2024 alone (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). Interestingly, 60% of these applications in 2024 were for male domestic workers, a notable trend within this sector (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). This sustained high volume demonstrates that the reforms have addressed a critical need within the domestic worker community, empowering them to actively seek better working conditions and new opportunities. 3.2.4 Emerging Challenges: Persistent Vulnerabilities While legal inclusion has been achieved, dedicated monitoring and protection for this group remain a focal point for ensuring that \u201claw-in-action\u201d matches the \u201claw-on-the-books.\u201d The progress on mobility is paired with high grievance rates. In 2024, the U.S. State Department noted 5,218 complaints from domestic workers, a significant increase from 1,391 in 2023 (U.S. Department of State 2025). This sharp rise does not necessarily signal worsening conditions; rather, it more likely points to a greater awareness among domestic workers of their rights and an increased trust in and access to complaint mechanisms (U.S. Department of State 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 40, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_99cea4498200", "text": "g conditions; rather, it more likely points to a greater awareness among domestic workers of their rights and an increased trust in and access to complaint mechanisms (U.S. Department of State 2025). However, the long-term stability of these protections has been tested. In June-July 2024, Qatar\u2019s advisory Shura Council proposed measures to reinstate an employer permission requirement for domestic workers seeking to leave the country (Page 2024). The proposal would have required Page 15 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 domestic workers to submit departure requests through an online portal at least five days in advance and allowed employers to deny approval. While the proposal was not enacted as of early 2025, the discussion itself created significant uncertainty and highlighted the risk of policy backsliding on critical labour reforms (Page 2024). This underscores the persistent view among some stakeholders that employer control is necessary and highlights the unique vulnerability of domestic workers, who often face a greater risk of exploitation and abuse (Page 2024). 4.

The cornerstone of the reforms, the abolition of the No-Objection Certificate (NOC), has unlocked labour mobility. The impact of this change is evident in its high uptake; between September 2020 and October 2023, the Ministry of Labour processed over one million EC applications, approving more than 669,000 of them (ILO 2024a; ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). This newfound freedom introduces competition among employers, incentivizing them to oVer better wages and conditions to attract and retain talent (ILO 2022a). This eVect is consistent with evidence from a similar reform in the UAE, where relaxing mobility restrictions was shown to reduce the monopsony power of firms and increase incumbent workers\u2019 wages (Naidu, Nyarko, and Wang 2014).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 42, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_eb4807110ae8", "text": "evidence from a similar reform in the UAE, where relaxing mobility restrictions was shown to reduce the monopsony power of firms and increase incumbent workers\u2019 wages (Naidu, Nyarko, and Wang 2014). Surveys confirm that expatriate workers perceive the removal of the NOC as one of the most significant recent reforms (Diop et al. 2021). \u2022 Exit without permits has become the norm for the vast majority of workers, removing a key tool of coercion. The exit permit system, which previously tied a worker\u2019s ability to leave the country to their employer\u2019s consent, has been nearly dismantled in a phased approach. Law No. 13 of 2018 removed the requirement for most workers, and Ministerial Decision No. 95 of 2019, which came into force on 16 January 2020, extended this right to almost all remaining categories, including domestic workers and those in the oil and gas sector (ILO 2020b). This reform directly addressed and removed a major instrument of control under the pre-reform kafala system. \u2022 The minimum wage and expanded WPS have strengthened workers\u2019 baseline bargaining power. In March 2021, Qatar established the region\u2019s first non-discriminatory Page 16 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 minimum wage, a policy that directly benefited over 280,000 workers by increasing their basic wage (ILO 2022a; MoL 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 43, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f1feca84a039", "text": "6 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 minimum wage, a policy that directly benefited over 280,000 workers by increasing their basic wage (ILO 2022a; MoL 2021). In line with economic principles, the establishment of a wage floor serves to redistribute earnings and strengthen the baseline bargaining position of low-paid workers (Terrell and Almeida 2008). This is enforced through the expanded Wage Protection System (WPS), an electronic salary transfer system that monitors payments. The WPS has achieved extensive coverage, with over 1.66 million workers (96% of the eligible workforce) registered, ensuring a high degree of compliance and transparency in wage payment (MoL 2021; ILO 2019a). \u2022 Digitalized MoL services have lowered transaction costs, standardized procedures, and improved traceability. Aligning with Qatar\u2019s broader national strategy of digital transformation (MCIT 2013; MCIT 2024; MCIT n.d.), the Ministry of Labour has increasingly digitalized its services to streamline administrative processes. A key example is the revised electronic platform for processing ECs, launched in May 2024, which allows both workers and new employers to initiate applications digitally, eliminating paper forms and reducing processing times (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025; MoL 2024b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 44, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bb44e2aed1ee", "text": "2024, which allows both workers and new employers to initiate applications digitally, eliminating paper forms and reducing processing times (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025; MoL 2024b).

While public adoption of e-government services is still growing, these digital tools are critical for making legal reforms accessible and eVective in practice (Al-Kuabaisi, Al-Thani, and Al-Emadi 2022). 4.1.2 Persistent Risks: Bottlenecks and Frictions While the legal reforms are significant, their practical implementation faces persistent bottlenecks and risks that impede the full realization of worker freedoms. These challenges highlight a continuing gap between \u201claw-on-the-books\u201d and \u201claw-in-action.\u201d \u2022 Employer Retaliation and Coercion: Despite the legal changes, workers who exercise their rights, particularly the right to change jobs, continue to face retaliatory actions from employers. These practices include the filing of false \u201cabsconding\u201d charges, which can lead to a worker\u2019s arrest and deportation, non-payment of final wages, and the illegal retention of passports to restrict their movement (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025; Kalush and Saraswathi 2024; Page 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 45, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_89259a75d1ef", "text": "and deportation, non-payment of final wages, and the illegal retention of passports to restrict their movement (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025; Kalush and Saraswathi 2024; Page 2024). This creates a climate of fear that can deter workers from leaving an exploitative job or pursuing legal remedies (Amnesty International 2016). Such practices of deception and coercion are deeply rooted in the previous system and undermine the practical ability of a worker to exercise their newfound rights (Damir-Geilsdorf 2016). \u2022 Recruitment Debt and Fees: The charging of recruitment fees to workers, which is illegal in Qatar, remains a major structural barrier to freedom. Although regulations require sponsors (employers) to bear all recruitment costs, these are often passed on to workers through recruitment agencies in their home countries (Babbitt et al. 2023; Damir- Geilsdorf 2016). Workers take on significant loans, often at high interest rates, to pay these fees, starting their employment in a state of debt bondage. This debt creates a coercive dynamic that undermines a worker\u2019s practical ability to leave an exploitative job, regardless of local laws allowing them to change employers (Babbitt et al. 2023; Amnesty Page 17 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 International 2016).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 46, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_cd93eeaae375", "text": "job, regardless of local laws allowing them to change employers (Babbitt et al. 2023; Amnesty Page 17 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 International 2016). Research shows that this debt burden is a key factor in workers\u2019 vulnerability and can take a significant portion of their employment period to repay (Damir-Geilsdorf 2016). \u2022 Transparency and E_icacy of Remedies: While mechanisms like the Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund (WSIF) have been established to provide financial redress, their eVectiveness is hampered by a lack of transparency and operational limitations. There is a call from independent monitors for more granular, public data on the WSIF\u2019s disbursements, including beneficiary counts by sector and nationality and processing timelines, to build trust and demonstrate eVectiveness (MRRORS 2025). Reports indicate that the fund has payout caps that may not cover the full extent of wages owed, and workers can face long, unspecified waits for their cases to be heard at the Dispute Settlement Committee stage, which is the only point at which the WSIF can release funds. This leaves many workers without income or the ability to find a new job while they await resolution (MRRORS 2025). \u2022 Policy Stability and Protections for Domestic Workers: The long-term stability of reforms, especially for the most vulnerable groups, remains a significant risk.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3d1a5fe09686", "text": "hey await resolution (MRRORS 2025). \u2022 Policy Stability and Protections for Domestic Workers: The long-term stability of reforms, especially for the most vulnerable groups, remains a significant risk. As noted previously (see Section 3.2.4), Qatar\u2019s advisory Shura Council in June-July 2024 proposed reinstating an employer permission requirement for domestic workers seeking to leave the country (Page 2024; MRRORS 2024; The Shura Council 2024). Although the proposal was not enacted as of early 2025, the discussion itself created significant uncertainty. This underscores the unique vulnerability of domestic workers and the risk of policy backsliding on critical labour reforms (Hawkes et al. 2023). 4.2 Proactive Governance: Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies The issues outlined above are not incidental; they point to deeper structural factors that will determine whether Qatar\u2019s reforms remain durable. These structural factors can be grouped into four strategic levers. An analysis of the reforms\u2019 successes and failures reveals four key drivers of \u201creal\u201d freedom of contract and movement that must be protected and enhanced. Figure 2. Four Strategic Lvers Sustaining Worker Freedom After Kafala Reform These levers translate \u201claw-on-the books\u201d into \u201claw-in-action\u201d by making freedom of movement and wage recovery real. 4.2.1 Strategic Lever 1: Eliminating Legal Levers of Control The abolition of the exit permit and NOC requirements was the essential first step.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 48, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_577a04e38396", "text": "by making freedom of movement and wage recovery real. 4.2.1 Strategic Lever 1: Eliminating Legal Levers of Control The abolition of the exit permit and NOC requirements was the essential first step. It fundamentally reshaped bargaining dynamics by reducing employer dependency and creating a more contestable labour market. These legal instruments were primary sources of employers\u2019 monopsony power, a market condition where employers have significant wage-setting power due to restricted worker mobility. Economic theory predicts that in such environments, wages are suppressed below workers\u2019 marginal product (Webber 2020). Removing these legal restrictions Page 18 of 33 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 14th, 2025 increases the labour supply elasticity facing the firm, forcing employers to compete for workers and pushing wages higher (Naidu, Nyarko, and Wang 2014). Evidence from a similar reform in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) demonstrates this eVect in practice. The UAE\u2019s 2011 reform, which allowed workers to change employers after their contract expired without their previous employer\u2019s consent, reduced the monopsony power of firms. This led to an increase in incumbent workers\u2019 earnings of over 10% and a higher rate of firm retention, a distinctive signature of reduced market power where both wages and employment quantities for incumbent workers rise (Naidu, Nyarko, and Wang 2014).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 49, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e574fad2a82e", "text": "of over 10% and a higher rate of firm retention, a distinctive signature of reduced market power where both wages and employment quantities for incumbent workers rise (Naidu, Nyarko, and Wang 2014). The impact in Qatar has been similarly transformative, unlocking labour mobility on a massive scale. Before the reforms, job mobility was extremely limited, with only around 9,000 and 18,000 workers changing jobs in 2018 and 2019, respectively (ILO 2022a). Following the legal changes, the uptake was immediate and substantial. Between September 2020 and October 2023, the Ministry of Labour processed over one million EC applications, approving more than 669,000 of them (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). This newfound freedom introduces competition among employers, incentivizing them to oVer better wages and conditions to attract and retain talent (ILO 2022a). Surveys confirm that expatriate workers perceive the removal of the NOC as one of the most significant recent reforms (Ewers et al. 2023). Beyond improving worker welfare, these reforms also enhance overall market eViciency by reducing \u2018labour hoarding,\u2019 the practice of keeping more workers than necessary, and allowing for a better allocation of labour to meet the needs of a productive economy (Kagan and Cholewinski 2022). 4.2.2 Strategic Lever 2: Administrative Capacity and Clarity De jure rights become de facto access only through eVicient, clear, and predictable administration.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 50, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bf2992c8e8d3", "text": "economy (Kagan and Cholewinski 2022). 4.2.2 Strategic Lever 2: Administrative Capacity and Clarity De jure rights become de facto access only through eVicient, clear, and predictable administration. The conversion of legal potential into practical reality is contingent on the state\u2019s administrative capacity to implement and enforce its own rules (Amengual 2014; Peters 2015). The eVectiveness of reforms depends on the consistent application of the law by front-line agents like labour inspectors and ministry oVicials, a concept known as \u201cstreet-level bureaucracy\u201d (Piore and Schrank 2007; Evans 2020). Recognizing this, Qatar\u2019s strategy has decisively focused on leveraging digitalization to bolster administrative capacity and clarity, thereby reducing ambiguity and standardizing procedures. This aligns with global best practices, which identify digitalization as a core component of competent and eVective governance (ILO 2025). A key example is the Ministry of Labour\u2019s revised electronic platform for processing ECs, launched in May 2024. This streamlined online portal allows both workers and new employers to initiate applications digitally, eliminating the need for paper forms and improving transparency by notifying each party for approval (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025; MoL 2024a).

Despite significant progress in streamlining procedures, many observers note a persistent gap between the reformed laws and the on-the-ground reality for workers (Calo 2023).

These two pillars are essential in labour markets characterized by significant power imbalances, where the formal freedom to contract can mask underlying coercive dynamics (Bagenstos 2020). In labour markets with monopsony power, where employers have significant wage-setting power due to factors like restricted worker mobility, wages can be suppressed below workers\u2019 marginal product (Azar and Marinescu 2024). The pre-reform kafala system, by tying workers to a single employer, created precisely such a market condition which enabled widespread exploitation (OVia 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-14", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 53, "total_chunks": 87, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q1_EN_2025-10-14_v1.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-14", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b9580e6359db", "text": "al product (Azar and Marinescu 2024). The pre-reform kafala system, by tying workers to a single employer, created precisely such a market condition which enabled widespread exploitation (OVia 2023). The introduction of a non-discriminatory minimum wage establishes a \u201cwage floor,\u201d a baseline that strengthens the bargaining position of low-paid workers and limits the extent of wage exploitation (Terrell and Almeida 2008). This policy directly mitigates the eVects of monopsony power by raising wages, thereby creating a more competitive labour market and ensuring that the employment contract does not fall below a basic threshold of decency (Azar and Marinescu 2024). However, a wage floor alone is insuVicient if wages are not paid in a timely or complete manner. Wage theft: which includes illegal deductions, delayed payment, or non-payment of wages: is a primary tool of coercion and a key driver of forced labour, as it creates dependency and can trap workers in debt bondage (Harkins 2020; ILO 2009). An \u201ceVective remedy\u201d requires not only a legal judgment in the worker\u2019s favor but also a credible mechanism for recovery.

The persistence of these frictions demonstrates that changing the law is only the first step. The primary obstacles that remain are the powerful economic incentives within the transnational recruitment industry, the deep-seated power imbalances that continue to define employer-worker relationships, and the resulting gaps in enforcement. The business model of the international recruitment industry remains a core structural impediment. This system creates perverse incentives by allowing the costs of recruitment to be passed on to workers, who are the least able to aVord them (Anadolu Ajans\u0131 2025). This practice is not just a matter of a few rogue agencies; it is a systemic issue where Qatari-based companies contribute to the problem by imposing costs on recruiters with the knowledge that these expenses will ultimately be borne by the workers (Human Rights Watch 2022). This creates a market where ethical recruiters who absorb these costs are at a competitive disadvantage, and it institutionalizes debt bondage as a fundamental feature of labour migration to the region (The Times of India 2025).

Many employers continue to operate with a mindset of sponsorship and control, leading to practices such as retaliation against workers who try to change jobs or the demand for \u201cde facto\u201d NOCs (ILO Project OVice for the State of Qatar 2025). This dynamic undermines the eVectiveness of legal remedies. Workers burdened by recruitment debt are less likely to challenge abuses, and the dispute resolution system itself struggles to operate eVectively in an environment of such starkly unequal power (Calo 2023).

Conclusion Qatar\u2019s labour reforms since 2018 have materially expanded workers\u2019 freedom of contract and movement, both in law and, crucially, in practice. The abolition of exit permits, the removal of the NOC requirement, the approval of hundreds of thousands of ECs, and the establishment of a national minimum wage collectively point to a structural shift away from the most restrictive features of the old sponsorship regime. However, practical freedom remains contingent on robust enforcement and transparency. Persistent risks, including employer retaliation, recruitment debt, and policy stability concerns for domestic workers, can dilute the lived impact of statutory rights if not carefully managed.

Introduction: Structural Conditions Behind Persistent Labor Rights Violations in Qatar This introduction establishes the fundamental context of Qatar\u2019s labor market, outlining the strategic reforms undertaken and defining the persistent gap between legal frameworks and on- the-ground realities for migrant workers. 1.1 The Strategic Imperative of Qatarization: Context, Goals, and Progress Qatar\u2019s strategic goal of developing a competitive and diversified economy under its National Vision 2030 is fundamentally shaped by the unique structure of its labor market (General Secretariat for Development Planning (GSDP) 2008). This market is defined by one of the world\u2019s most pronounced demographic asymmetries, a condition that has both enabled rapid economic growth and created structural challenges for labor rights enforcement. Page 2 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 1.1.1 Demographic and Economic Context The Qatari economic boom, fueled by its vast hydrocarbon wealth, created a demand for labor that far outstripped the capacity of its small national population.

This demographic reality is even more pronounced in the private sector, where non-nationals accounted for 99.4% of the employed population in 2023 (NPC 2025c; Gulf Labour Markets, Migration and Population (GLMM) 2024). This reliance on foreign labor is coupled with a deep segmentation of the workforce. The vast majority of migrant workers are employed in lower-wage sectors such as construction, hospitality, and domestic work (De Bel-Air 2017). Conversely, the Qatari workforce is primarily concentrated in the public sector, with 82% of the total Qatari labor force employed there (NPC n.d.). The national strategy of \u201cQatarization\u201d is therefore aimed at increasing the participation of Qatari citizens in the private sector, a goal that requires addressing complex economic and social incentives. 1.1.2 The Kafala System and the Foundation for Reform Historically, the relationship between employers and migrant workers in Qatar was governed by the kafala (sponsorship) system.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bd3cf1a16d37", "text": "social incentives. 1.1.2 The Kafala System and the Foundation for Reform Historically, the relationship between employers and migrant workers in Qatar was governed by the kafala (sponsorship) system.

This system granted sponsors significant control over workers, creating a power imbalance that was widely identified as a key driver of labor rights violations, including exploitation and forced labor (International Labour Organization (ILO) 2022a; De Bel-Air 2017). Recognizing these structural challenges, and in alignment with its National Vision 2030, Qatar has, over the last decade, embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious legislative reform agenda. This agenda, developed in close cooperation with the ILO and other international partners, has aimed to dismantle the most problematic aspects of the kafala system and establish a modern labor market framework that protects workers\u2019 rights (ILO 2022a; ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2023).

Key pillars of this agenda include: \u2022 Enhanced Labor Mobility: The \u201cNo Objection Certificate\u201d (NOC), a requirement for workers to get their employer\u2019s permission to change jobs, was abolished. This has fundamentally transformed labor mobility. Between September 2020 and October 2023, authorities approved 669,198 job change applications, a stark contrast to the pre-reform era (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2023). In addition, exit permit requirements were eliminated for the vast majority of workers, including domestic workers, allowing them to leave the country without employer permission. \u2022 Wage and Wage Protection: Through Law No. 17 of 2020, Qatar became the first country in the region to introduce a non-discriminatory minimum wage, which entered into force in March 2021 (State of Qatar 2020a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c1026dff869c", "text": "age Protection: Through Law No. 17 of 2020, Qatar became the first country in the region to introduce a non-discriminatory minimum wage, which entered into force in March 2021 (State of Qatar 2020a). The law mandates a minimum monthly basic wage of QAR 1,000, plus allowances for food (QAR 300) and housing (QAR 500) if not provided by the employer (State of Qatar 2020a). This reform directly benefited over 400,000 workers, or 20% of the private sector workforce (ILO 2021). Compliance is monitored through the Wage Protection System (WPS), an electronic salary transfer system in which 96% of eligible workers are registered (Ministry of Labour (MoL) 2021). \u2022 Dispute Resolution and Worker Support: To accelerate the adjudication of labor complaints, specialized Labour Dispute Settlement Committees were established. To provide a safety net for workers whose employers fail to pay wages due to insolvency or other issues, the Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund was created. As of August 2023, the fund had disbursed approximately QAR 2.3 billion, with direct payments reaching more than 70,000 workers (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2023).

Page 4 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 1.2 The Duality of Reform: Persistent Violations Despite Qatar\u2019s ambitious labor reforms, a significant gap between law and practice persists. International human rights organizations, United Nations bodies, the U.S. State Department, and academic researchers continue to document serious and systemic labor rights violations (U.S. Department of State 2025a). While legal frameworks have been modernized, their implementation and enforcement remain inconsistent, allowing foundational problems to endure (Calo 2023). 1.2.1 Late or Non-Payment of Wages (Wage Theft) Wage theft remains the most common and persistent form of exploitation faced by migrant workers in Qatar (Amnesty International 2022b). This includes employers delaying wages for weeks or months, paying less than the contractually promised amount, or imposing arbitrary deductions. The U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2025 Tra_icking in Persons Report noted that in a single year, Qatari prosecutors classified 8,199 cases of non-payment of wages as administrative violations under residency and labor laws, rather than pursuing them as potential criminal tra_icking o_enses, which weakens deterrence (U.S. Department of State 2025b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b08e4155622f", "text": "nt of wages as administrative violations under residency and labor laws, rather than pursuing them as potential criminal tra_icking o_enses, which weakens deterrence (U.S. Department of State 2025b). The consistent availability of o_icial data, while highlighting the scale of the problem, is a critical element for data-driven policy analysis and tracking long-term trends (Ewers 2016). More recent data from the Qatari Ministry of Labour and the ILO show that wage-related grievances continue to be the primary cause for complaints. The Ministry of Labour\u2019s own statistical bulletins consistently illustrate this high volume. For instance, in February 2023, the Labour Disputes Department received 2,374 complaints, with 1,480 remaining under consideration by the end of the period (MoL 2023). This trend continued, with another 2,212 new complaints filed in February 2024 (MoL 2024b). Highlighting the sheer scale of the issue, the bulletin for the second quarter (Q2) of 2025 reported that while 1,844 new worker complaints were received, a total of 4,951 cases were handled (3,358 settled amicably and 1,593 referred to committees), indicating a significant ongoing backlog from previous periods. During that quarter alone, 1,593 cases were escalated to the Labour Dispute Settlement Committees, which in turn issued 1,484 rulings (MoL 2025b). These figures demonstrate that thousands of workers continue to experience wage disputes severe enough to require formal intervention each quarter.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_99da85f481af", "text": "es, which in turn issued 1,484 rulings (MoL 2025b).

This data aligns with reports suggesting the post-World Cup economic slowdown has exacerbated the problem, with some employers telling workers to wait indefinitely for new projects without pay, leaving them in a precarious situation (Human Rights Watch 2023). 1.2.2 Passport Confiscation and Document Retention Qatari law prohibits employers from confiscating workers\u2019 passports. However, the practice remains widespread and is a significant tool of control. A major survey by Gardner et al. (2013) found that an overwhelming 90% of low-income migrant workers reported that their employer possessed their passport. The U.S. State Department has repeatedly identified this practice as a core tra_icking risk, noting in its 2024 and 2025 reports that \u201cthe vast majority of expatriate workers\u2019 passports were in their employers\u2019 possession\u201d (U.S. Department of State 2025a; 2025b).

The 2024 National Report on Combating Human Tra_icking explicitly lists the \u201cpossession of fraudulent identity documents or cases where documents are withheld by employers\u201d as a key indicator for first responders to identify potential victims of human tra_icking (MoL and National Committee for Combating Human Tra_icking (NCCHT) 2024). While some workers may voluntarily hand over their passports for safekeeping due to a lack of secure storage in their accommodations (Gardner et al. 2013), the practice is a key indicator of forced labor as it severely restricts a worker\u2019s ability to leave the country, change jobs, or even file o_icial complaints without fear of immediate retaliation (Amnesty International 2022b). 1.2.3 Coercion and Retaliation: The Persistence of Kafala-like Controls While the legal requirement for workers to obtain a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to change jobs has been abolished, its use persists in practice, representing a significant remnant of the previous sponsorship (kafala) system (Jureidini 2019).

This environment enables employers to use a range of retaliatory and coercive tactics against workers who try to assert their rights. Such tactics include filing false \u201cabsconding\u201d charges, which can lead to a worker\u2019s arrest and deportation, or unilaterally cancelling a worker\u2019s Residence Permit (QID), rendering them undocumented (ILO 2025). Employer control also extends to housing for many low-wage workers, particularly in construction and domestic work. This arrangement gives employers immense leverage, as a worker who files a complaint can be instantly evicted, leaving them without shelter or income (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024). Despite legal standards, reports persist of workers being housed in crowded, unsanitary, and hazardous labor camps, sometimes with dozens of people to a single room and inadequate access to clean water or electricity (N. H. Nasir, Haque, and Awang 2023). These practices, controlling a worker\u2019s legal status and their basic housing, e_ectively recreate the power imbalances of the older kafala system, where the employer maintains excessive control over a worker\u2019s life and freedom of movement (O_ia 2023). 1.2.4 Barriers to Redress Qatar established specialized Labour Dispute Settlement Committees in 2018 to accelerate the adjudication of labor complaints.

For low-wage workers who are already indebted and not receiving a salary, such lengthy delays are devastating (Amnesty International 2023a). Furthermore, even when workers receive a favorable ruling from the committees, they often struggle to collect compensation, as some employers refuse to comply or have become insolvent. This often forces workers to accept settlements for far less than they are owed or abandon their cases entirely and return to their home countries empty-handed (Human Rights Watch 2023). 1.3 The Central Problem: A Persistent Gap Between Law and Practice The central problem in Qatar\u2019s labor market is not the absence of legal reforms but the persistence of structural conditions that allow labor rights violations to endure. Key drivers, combined with the lingering power imbalances of the kafala system, create an environment Page 6 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 where exploitation is profitable for employers and challenging for workers to contest (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 15, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b6e1285a76bc", "text": "Page 6 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 where exploitation is profitable for employers and challenging for workers to contest (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024). 1.3.1 Recruitment Debt as a Core Driver of Exploitation A primary structural driver of violations is the pervasive issue of recruitment debt. Many migrant workers arrive in Qatar already indebted, having mobilized significant resources, often at exorbitant interest rates, to cover migration costs (Raj and Rahman 2023). While Qatari law prohibits charging recruitment fees to workers, the practice continues through informal and unregulated networks that operate outside its jurisdiction (Aslam 2025; Khan 2022). This systematic cost-shifting is often driven by an \u201cinverted payment chain,\u201d where recruitment costs are passed down to workers through a network of sub-agents, inflating the final amount with kickbacks for visas and other illicit charges (Starbird 2017). An investigation by The Guardian revealed the scale of these costs, finding that migrants from Bangladesh and Nepal typically pay fees of $3,000 to $4,000 and $1,000 to $1,500, respectively. For many low-wage workers earning as little as $275 a month, this means working for at least a year just to pay o_ these fees (Pattisson and Acharya 2023). This pre-migration debt is a foundational element of modern bonded labor, fundamentally restricting a worker\u2019s bargaining power.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 16, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_11fd2f913760", "text": "t least a year just to pay o_ these fees (Pattisson and Acharya 2023). This pre-migration debt is a foundational element of modern bonded labor, fundamentally restricting a worker\u2019s bargaining power. Workers burdened by loans are more likely to tolerate abusive conditions, such as delayed or unpaid wages, for fear of losing their jobs before they can repay their debts. This dynamic gives employers significant leverage, knowing that indebted workers are desperate to avoid deportation (Mottaz 2023). 1.3.2 Subcontracting and the DiPusion of Responsibility The structure of Qatar\u2019s large-scale infrastructure projects often relies on multi-layered subcontracting, which di_uses responsibility for wage payments and worker welfare. The challenges posed by these complex supply chains are well-documented, with the ILO identifying the construction sector\u2019s reliance on \u201coften long and complex sub-contracting and supply chains\u201d as a key source of worker vulnerability in Qatar (ILO and Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social A_airs of Qatar (ADLSA) 2021). In this system, a major firm contracts a primary supplier, which then outsources labor to smaller subcontractors. When financial problems arise, it is typically the subcontractors at the bottom of the chain who stop paying wages, while the main contractor and the client often deny responsibility, stating that the a_ected workers are not their direct employees.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3122bf12bc66", "text": "e subcontractors at the bottom of the chain who stop paying wages, while the main contractor and the client often deny responsibility, stating that the a_ected workers are not their direct employees. This multi-tiered system creates significant barriers for workers seeking redress. They often cannot identify, let alone sue, the financially stronger entities higher up the contracting chain. This structure allows wage theft to persist even with the Wage Protection System (WPS) in place, as the system can detect late payments but cannot ensure wages are paid when a subcontractor collapses or defaults. As a result, even with reforms like the WPS, enforcement remains weak and the system\u2019s e_ectiveness is undermined (Aslam 2025). 1.3.3 The Legacy of Kafala and a Climate of Fear Despite significant legal reforms, remnants of the kafala system persist in practice, as outlined in Section 1.2.3. This persistent power imbalance, rooted in employer control over a worker\u2019s legal residency and housing, fosters a climate of fear that deters workers from reporting violations Page 7 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 (Babar and Vora 2022).

Key Drivers of Violations: Employer Motivations and Worker Vulnerabilities This section dissects the structural forces that make violations like wage theft and passport confiscation both profitable for employers and di_icult for workers to challenge. 2.1 The Psychological Contract: Expatriate Expectations vs. Organizational Realities Many migrant workers arrive in Qatar with a set of expectations that are often broken upon arrival. This disconnect is rooted in a recruitment system where significant costs and risks are shifted onto the workers. 2.1.1 The Mechanics of Deception and Debt As outlined in Section 1.3.1, most low-wage migrant workers arrive already indebted due to recruitment fees passed down through informal agent chains; this debt amplifies the impact of later contract substitution and delayed payment. This financial burden is compounded by deceptive practices like contract substitution, where the terms of employment change between the initial o_er and the final contract signed upon arrival (Jayaprakash 2024). A 2019 survey confirmed that 32% of workers in Qatar received a lower salary than what they were originally promised (Fargues, Shah, and Brouwer 2019).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6b7922e7a9fd", "text": "ontract signed upon arrival (Jayaprakash 2024). A 2019 survey confirmed that 32% of workers in Qatar received a lower salary than what they were originally promised (Fargues, Shah, and Brouwer 2019). This discrepancy represents a fundamental breach of the psychological contract, leaving workers with less income to repay the debts they incurred. 2.1.2 The Cycle of Debt and Dependency This pre-migration debt is a cornerstone of modern bonded labor, creating a cycle of dependency with several cascading consequences: \u2022 Tolerance for Abuse: Indebtedness forces workers to accept harsh working conditions they might otherwise refuse (Alowais and Suliman 2025). This situation creates a \u201csunk cost e_ect,\u201d a psychological trap where the worker feels compelled to continue in an exploitative situation to justify the initial financial sacrifice (Babbitt et al. 2023). \u2022 Leverage for Employers: Employers can delay wage payments, knowing that workers are \u201cpowerless to challenge them\u201d under the threat of deportation (Amnesty International 2022a). \u2022 Passport and ID Control: The practice of employers holding workers\u2019 passports or residence cards is a key tool of control, preventing workers from leaving the country or seeking other employment (Gardner et al. 2013).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_643bbee97b7c", "text": "ntrol: The practice of employers holding workers\u2019 passports or residence cards is a key tool of control, preventing workers from leaving the country or seeking other employment (Gardner et al. 2013). 2.2 The Labyrinth of Subcontracting: DiNusing Responsibility for Wages Large infrastructure, hospitality, logistics, delivery, and private security operations in Qatar often rely on tiered subcontracting: a major firm (or event organizer) contracts a primary supplier, which in turn outsources to secondary or tertiary subcontractors that directly employ the workers. Page 8 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 When cash-flow problems appear at the bottom of this chain, the worker\u2019s practical access to wages often depends on state intervention through the Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund (WSIF), whose role and limitations are analyzed in Section 4.2.2, rather than direct corporate accountability. 2.2.1 Employer control over residency, housing, and documents As detailed in Sections 1.2.3 and 1.3.3, employer control over residency, housing, and documents continues to function as a kafala-like lever. Here we focus on how that interacts with multi-tier subcontracting to trap workers in wage disputes by creating significant legal and bureaucratic hurdles to changing jobs (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_8f5448d5c2bb", "text": "re we focus on how that interacts with multi-tier subcontracting to trap workers in wage disputes by creating significant legal and bureaucratic hurdles to changing jobs (Kalush and Saraswathi 2024). 2.2.2 Enforcement Gaps and Slow Dispute Resolution Qatar has made visible investments in monitoring and enforcement, reflected in the high volume of activity reported throughout the latter half of 2024. For instance, the Ministry of Labour\u2019s inspection teams conducted 12,816 visits in the second quarter, 8,045 in the third, and 8,057 in the fourth, filing thousands of violation reports in the process (MoL 2024c-d; 2025a). Alongside these inspections, the Labour Disputes Department has been consistently active, addressing 6,849 worker complaints in Q2, 8,027 in Q3, and 6,316 in Q4 (MoL 2024c-d; 2025a). However, despite this sustained enforcement activity, multiple sources point to persistent issues that create a significant gap between the law and its practice: \u2022 Delays in adjudication: A primary challenge is the slow pace of the dispute resolution process. The International Labour Organization (ILO) notes that a quarter of all worker complaints are referred to the Labour Dispute Settlement Committees (LDSCs), which \u201cleads to a long period for workers to wait to have their cases heard\u201d (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 22, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_94f461b39173", "text": "plaints are referred to the Labour Dispute Settlement Committees (LDSCs), which \u201cleads to a long period for workers to wait to have their cases heard\u201d (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2025).

The scale of non-payment is evidenced by the Fund\u2019s disbursements, which reached QAR 2.3 billion to over 70,000 workers by August 2023 (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2023).

While authorities have made e_orts in outreach, significant gaps in these areas persist, enabling continued labor rights violations. A critical lack of awareness prevents many workers from exercising their rights. A 2021 survey found 32% of low-income workers were \u201cnot at all familiar\u201d with recent labor law changes (Diop et al. 2021).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 24, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0218379ea965", "text": "itical lack of awareness prevents many workers from exercising their rights. A 2021 survey found 32% of low-income workers were \u201cnot at all familiar\u201d with recent labor law changes (Diop et al. 2021). This information deficit allows exploitative practices, such as employers demanding a \u201cNo-Objection Certificate\u201d (NOC) for job changes despite its legal abolishment, to endure (ILO 2024). In response, the MoL and the ILO have increased engagement with migrant community leaders to disseminate information on rights and complaint mechanisms (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2025). Language barriers present a more fundamental obstacle. The multilingual nature of the workforce means many workers cannot understand contracts, safety instructions, or legal procedures, which are often in Arabic or English (Sweet et al. 2025). This can lead to contract deception, workplace accidents, and an inability to access justice. Recognizing this, an early ILO report recommended that the Ministry \u201censure that adequate interpretation and translation services are available\u201d across all dispute resolution bodies (Fino and Pintado 2019). Finally, a climate of fear and a deficit of trust deter workers from reporting violations. Many fear employer retaliation, such as the filing of false \u201cabsconding\u201d charges, cancellation of residency permits, or eviction from housing (ILO 2023a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_90d3754b15fc", "text": "ust deter workers from reporting violations.

This wide variability indicates that a large and unpredictable number of cases are not resolved amicably and must proceed to formal adjudication. \u2022 A Congested Pipeline to Formal Adjudication: Cases that are not resolved through initial mediation are referred to the Labour Dispute Settlement Committees (LDSCs), the formal judicial bodies for labor issues. This pipeline is constantly fed by a substantial number of unresolved disputes. On average, more than 1,700 cases were escalated to the LDSCs each quarter between Q2 2024 and Q2 2025 (MoL 2024c-d; MoL 2025a-b). This steady flow, amounting to hundreds of cases every month, underscores the sheer volume of disputes that are complex or contentious enough to require a formal ruling, highlighting the systemic pressure on Qatar\u2019s labor justice system. These figures demonstrate that thousands of workers continue to experience wage disputes severe enough to require formal intervention each quarter.

A 2023 report from Amnesty International, published one year after the World Cup, rea_irmed that wage theft \u201cremains the most common form of exploitation facing migrant workers in Qatar,\u201d with many continuing to experience delayed or unpaid wages, unpaid overtime, and arbitrary deductions (Amnesty International 2023a). This includes workers across various sectors, from construction and security to the growing food delivery industry (Amnesty International 2023a; Human Rights Watch 2023). The primary causes of complaints lodged with the Labour Dispute Settlement Committees consistently concern the non-payment of wages and end-of-service benefits, and the denial of annual leave (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2021). 3.1.3 A Financial Indicator of Systemic Abuse The scale of wage theft is so significant that it necessitates a dedicated national fund to act as a safety net. The Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund (WSIF) was established to compensate workers when employers default on payments (State of Qatar 2018).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 31, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_82ec79553580", "text": "itates a dedicated national fund to act as a safety net.

The magnitude of its disbursements serves as a clear indicator of the systemic nature of wage non-payment. As of August 2023, the Fund had disbursed approximately QAR 2.3 billion to over 70,000 workers (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2023). This figure, which has been restated in early 2025 reports, confirms that the non-payment of wages is neither a minor nor an exceptional issue; it is a contemporary and structural crisis requiring a substantial, ongoing state-funded remedy (The Peninsula 2025c). The very existence and extensive use of this multi-billion riyal fund underscores that direct wage recovery from employers frequently fails, making state intervention a crucial, albeit reactive, solution for tens of thousands of workers.

While Qatari law explicitly prohibits the practice, multiple sources indicate it remains a persistent and widespread challenge, representing a critical gap between law and practice (Coalition on Labor Justice for Migrants in the Gulf 2024; U.S. Department of State 2025b). 3.2.1 The Legal Framework versus The Reality on the Ground Qatari law provides a clear legal stance against passport confiscation. Law No. 21 of 2015 requires employers to return passports to workers after residency procedures are complete and specifies that they can only be kept with the worker\u2019s written consent, carrying a penalty of up to QAR 25,000 for violations (NCCHT 2020; ILO 2023b). The Qatari government itself, in its 2024 National Report on Combating Human Tra_icking, identifies \u201ccases where documents are withheld by employers\u201d as a key indicator for first responders to identify potential victims of tra_icking (MoL and NCCHT 2024). Despite this legal framework, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2024 and 2025 Tra_icking in Persons Reports have repeatedly stated that \u201cpassport confiscation remained a widespread problem with insu_icient enforcement of penalties\u201d and that \u201cthe vast majority of expatriate workers\u2019 passports were in their employers\u2019 possession\u201d (U.S. Department of State 2024b; U.S.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_55c9c7b6c27c", "text": "a widespread problem with insu_icient enforcement of penalties\u201d and that \u201cthe vast majority of expatriate workers\u2019 passports were in their employers\u2019 possession\u201d (U.S. Department of State 2024b; U.S. Department of State 2025). This assessment is supported by long-term survey data. A 2014 survey found that 76% of blue-collar workers had surrendered their passport to their employer (Ewers 2016). More recent survey data collected between 2017 and 2021 indicates that while the situation may be improving, the practice persists, with approximately 32% of migrant workers reporting their passport was held by their employer or a recruitment agency (Ewers et al. 2023). 3.2.2 A Tool of Coercion and Control The practical e_ect of passport confiscation is the severe restriction of a worker\u2019s freedom. Without a passport or a valid Qatar ID (QID), a worker cannot easily change jobs, open a bank account, rent housing, or safely approach authorities (Migrant-Rights.Org n.d.). This creates a power imbalance that employers can exploit. For instance, if a worker complains about unpaid wages, an employer can threaten to file a report for \u201cabsconding\u201d, which could lead to detention and deportation (Amnesty International 2022b). This practice is a key indicator of forced labor, as it severely curtails a worker\u2019s ability to leave an abusive employment situation or file o_icial complaints without fear of retaliation (Amnesty International 2022b; MoL and NCCHT 2024).

The 2025 U.S. Tra_icking in Persons Report highlighted a significant enforcement gap, noting that Qatari prosecutors classified 154 cases of passport confiscation as administrative violations under residency and labor laws, rather than pursuing them as potential criminal tra_icking o_enses, which weakens deterrence (U.S. Department of State 2025b). 3.2.3 Nuances in Passport Retention While often a tool for exploitation, research reveals a more complex picture where not all instances of passport retention are coercive. Surveys have found that a significant number of workers voluntarily hand over their passports to employers for safekeeping (Ewers 2016). A 2014 survey found that of the workers who did not have their passport, 36% had given it to their employer by choice, citing a lack of secure storage in their shared accommodations (Ewers 2016). Page 13 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 This finding highlights that the lack of secure, personal storage space in labor camps contributes to the continuation of the practice.

Policy and Enforcement Landscape: State Mechanisms and Their Limitations This section evaluates the main tools Qatar has introduced to address these problems and the limits of those tools as described by o_icial sources, international organizations, and rights groups. 4.1 The Wage Protection System (WPS): Design, Progress, and Loopholes The Wage Protection System (WPS) is a cornerstone of Qatar\u2019s labor reform agenda and a primary tool for addressing wage theft. As an electronic salary transfer mechanism, it was designed to increase transparency and ensure that workers are paid correctly and on time, as stipulated by their contracts and Qatari Labour Law (M. Nasir 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 38, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b730606f0e58", "text": "nic salary transfer mechanism, it was designed to increase transparency and ensure that workers are paid correctly and on time, as stipulated by their contracts and Qatari Labour Law (M. Nasir 2025). While the system has fundamentally increased state visibility over private sector wage payments, its practical limitations and enforcement gaps mean that wage theft remains a persistent challenge (Richardson 2024). 4.1.1 Design and Mandate Introduced in 2015 through amendments to the Labour Law, the WPS mandates that all employers pay their workers via authorized Qatari banks (Commercial Bank of Qatar n.d.). This process creates a digital audit trail, allowing the Ministry of Labour (MoL) to monitor payments electronically. The system\u2019s stated objectives are to: \u2022 Protect workers from employers manipulating their financial entitlements. \u2022 Minimize labor disputes related to wages. \u2022 Provide an o_icial data source for the judiciary to use in resolving disputes. \u2022 Promote financial inclusion by enabling all workers, regardless of income level, to open bank accounts (Fino and Pintado 2019). Employers are required to submit a monthly Salary Information File (SIF) to their bank, detailing each employee\u2019s basic salary, overtime, allowances, and deductions. This data is then transmitted to the Qatar Central Bank and the MoL\u2019s WPS Unit for monitoring (Fino and Pintado 2019).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 39, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1429af9aac26", "text": "k, detailing each employee\u2019s basic salary, overtime, allowances, and deductions. This data is then transmitted to the Qatar Central Bank and the MoL\u2019s WPS Unit for monitoring (Fino and Pintado 2019). Failure to comply can trigger penalties, including fines of up to QAR 6,000 per violation and a temporary suspension of business operations (Kreston SVP 2025). 4.1.2 Documented Impact and Progress The WPS has had a measurable positive impact on the labor market. Its implementation has significantly reduced the proportion of workers paid in cash and has led to more timely wage payments (Fino and Pintado 2019). By 2020, 96% of eligible workers were covered by the WPS, a substantial increase from previous years, demonstrating enhanced compliance (ILO 2022a). The Page 15 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 system has undeniably served as an essential tool for the Labour Inspection Department and the Labour Dispute Settlement Committees, providing clear electronic evidence in cases of non- payment and helping to resolve disputes more e_iciently (The Peninsula 2025b). Furthermore, authorities have used WPS data to launch targeted inspections and block non-compliant companies from accessing government services, such as the issuance of new work permits (MoL 2025a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 40, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ceb9b7af44b2", "text": "Furthermore, authorities have used WPS data to launch targeted inspections and block non-compliant companies from accessing government services, such as the issuance of new work permits (MoL 2025a). 4.1.3 Persistent Gaps and Loopholes Despite its progress, the WPS is characterized by significant loopholes and enforcement deficiencies that savvy employers exploit, allowing wage theft to persist. International organizations and government reports consistently highlight that the system is more of a monitoring tool than a preventative one (Richardson 2024; Amnesty International 2019). \u2022 Data and System Limitations: The system\u2019s e_ectiveness is fundamentally limited by its reliance on employer-submitted data. The WPS can flag non-payment or late payment, but it cannot easily detect underpayment of overtime or unauthorized deductions, as it does not typically reconcile payments against the worker\u2019s original contract terms (Richardson 2024). An ILO assessment noted that key details like overtime and allowances are often bundled under a single \u201cAdditional Income\u201d category in the data file, making it impossible to verify correct calculations (Fino and Pintado 2019). \u2022 Employer Coercion and System Circumvention: The system is vulnerable to o_line circumvention. Rights groups and the U.S. Department of State report that some employers confiscate workers\u2019 ATM cards, withdraw their salaries, and pay them a reduced amount in cash, rendering the digital trail meaningless (U.S.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 41, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6e06aa6ddecf", "text": "nd the U.S. Department of State report that some employers confiscate workers\u2019 ATM cards, withdraw their salaries, and pay them a reduced amount in cash, rendering the digital trail meaningless (U.S. Department of State 2025a; Amnesty International 2019). Furthermore, employers may coerce workers into signing false payslips to present to labor inspectors as proof of payment (The Arab Weekly 2023). \u2022 Subcontracting and Insolvency: The WPS is weakest in complex subcontracting chains, which are common in Qatar\u2019s construction sector (Jayaprakash 2024). When a subcontractor defaults or becomes insolvent, the WPS can detect the non-payment but cannot compel a bankrupt company to pay. This leaves workers unpaid and reliant on the state\u2019s Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund (WSIF), shifting the WPS from a tool of proactive enforcement to a reactive data source for subsequent remediation e_orts (The Peninsula 2025a; The Peninsula 2025c). \u2022 Inconsistent Enforcement: The government does not always e_ectively enforce the law, and penalties are often less severe than for comparable financial crimes (U.S. Department of State 2025a). While thousands of violation reports are filed annually, the threat of penalties is not always a su_icient deterrent for non-compliant companies, who may be given multiple warnings and opportunities to rectify abuses before serious action is taken (The Peninsula 2021; Amnesty International 2023b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 42, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fa8586252d55", "text": "_icient deterrent for non-compliant companies, who may be given multiple warnings and opportunities to rectify abuses before serious action is taken (The Peninsula 2021; Amnesty International 2023b). This gap between detection and meaningful punishment undermines the system\u2019s deterrent e_ect. In conclusion, while the WPS is a critical component of Qatar\u2019s labor governance framework, its structural limitations and inconsistent enforcement mean it is not a comprehensive solution to Page 16 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 wage theft. The system is vulnerable to o_line circumvention precisely because the structural conditions outlined in this report, worker indebtedness and power imbalances, make it low-risk and profitable for employers to exploit these loopholes. It serves primarily as a reactive tool that flags violations after they occur, rather than a proactive system that prevents them (ILO 2022b). 4.2 State Institutions: Key Policy Levers for Change In response to persistent labor rights violations, the State of Qatar has established several key institutional mechanisms designed to provide more accessible and e_ective redress for workers.

An e_ective system should be independent, accessible, and e_icient (International Training Centre of the ILO (ITCILO) 2013). While Qatar\u2019s institutions demonstrate high capacity in processing a large volume of cases, a closer examination reveals a system struggling with enforcement gaps, procedural delays, and structural barriers that limit its overall e_ectiveness. 4.2.1 The Labour Dispute Settlement Committees (LDSCs): A High-Volume System Under Strain Established by Law No. 13 of 2017, the LDSCs were created to replace the country\u2019s notoriously slow labour courts and accelerate the adjudication of disputes.

Independent reports consistently document \u201conerous, six-month-plus timelines\u201d for cases, a delay that is devastating for low-wage workers who are often already indebted and without income (U.S. Department of State 2024a; U.S. Department of State 2025a; Calo 2023).

Employers frequently ignore judgments, become insolvent, or shut down operations, forcing workers to initiate a new, complex enforcement case in the separate civil courts (Calo 2023; Amnesty International 2019).

This turns mediation into a tool for disposing of complaints rather than delivering just outcomes (Amnesty International 2023a; Calo 2023). \u2022 Systemic Gaps: Overall, the system is described as an \u201cinadequate grievance and redress mechanism\u201d (Amnesty International 2024). The lack of state-funded legal aid, language barriers in a system that operates in Arabic, and the opacity of procedures leave many workers unable to e_ectively navigate the process (Amnesty International 2023a). In a positive step, the Ministry of Labour is preparing to launch a comprehensive review of the national dispute resolution system to identify these challenges and introduce more e_ective procedures (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2025). The government has also increased its engagement with migrant community leaders and international labor bodies to discuss and improve labour grievance mechanisms (Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI) 2024). 4.2.2 The Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund (WSIF): A Vital but Limited Safety Net Mandate and Scale Established under Law No.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e20e9bee9eee", "text": "ance mechanisms (Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI) 2024). 4.2.2 The Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund (WSIF): A Vital but Limited Safety Net Mandate and Scale Established under Law No. 17 of 2018, the WSIF was designed as a crucial safety net to address employers\u2019 failure to comply with LDSC rulings. Its primary mandate is to pay workers their awarded entitlements and then assume responsibility for recovering the funds from the employer (State of Qatar 2018). The scale of the fund\u2019s disbursements underscores the systemic nature of wage theft. \u2022 By August 2023, the Fund had paid approximately QAR 2.3 billion to over 70,000 workers (ILO Project O_ice for the State of Qatar 2023).

Limitations and Critiques While the WSIF provides a critical lifeline, its e_ectiveness is constrained by its design. It is a fundamentally reactive, not preventative, measure that compensates workers only after wage theft has occurred and a worker has already navigated a lengthy legal battle (Ford 2022; Farbenblum and Berg 2021). Its reach is highly restricted, as it only disburses payments to the minority of workers (with only about 25% of all complaints reaching this stage) whose cases have been successfully adjudicated by the LDSCs (MRRORS 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 48, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0ac8c17c60e7", "text": "ricted, as it only disburses payments to the minority of workers (with only about 25% of all complaints reaching this stage) whose cases have been successfully adjudicated by the LDSCs (MRRORS 2025). Accessing the fund is not automatic. The process often requires workers to initiate further legal action in civil courts to enforce the LDSC\u2019s decision, creating months of additional delay (Wells 2022). This structural limitation is compounded by a lack of transparency, as critics consistently point to a \u201cprofound lack of data\u201d on the WSIF\u2019s activities, which are not publicly available in an up-to-date, disaggregated form (Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor 2023; Farbenblum and Berg 2021). Furthermore, a 2022 ministerial decision capped the fund\u2019s disbursements to a maximum of three months\u2019 salary or QAR 20,000 (~USD 5,500), an amount often significantly less than a worker\u2019s total adjudicated entitlements (MRRORS 2023). As a result, firms that delay or withhold wages can still treat non-compliance as a manageable business risk. This dynamic can pressure financially desperate workers to accept unfair settlements (Ford 2022).

Conclusion The analysis reveals that while Qatar has implemented a comprehensive and ambitious suite of labor reforms, a significant gap persists between law and practice. The introduction of the Wage Protection System, Labour Dispute Settlement Committees (LDSC), and the Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund demonstrates a substantial state investment in creating enforcement and remediation mechanisms. These systems are active and handle a high volume of cases, indicating both their necessity and their institutional capacity. However, the same data, corroborated by international observers, show that foundational problems like wage theft, illegal recruitment fees, and passport confiscation remain widespread.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-10-29", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 52, "total_chunks": 77, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_3-Q2_EN_2025-10-29_v2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-10-29", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_68bf2ab624e4", "text": "onal capacity. However, the same data, corroborated by international observers, show that foundational problems like wage theft, illegal recruitment fees, and passport confiscation remain widespread. The key drivers of these violations are structural: the indebtedness of workers upon arrival, the Page 20 of 30 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team October 29th, 2025 di_usion of responsibility through multi-layered subcontracting, and the persistent power imbalance rooted in employer control over residency and housing. Consequently, Qatar\u2019s enforcement landscape is largely reactive. It has become adept at processing complaints and disbursing compensation after abuse has already occurred, but it has not yet eliminated the upstream incentives for employers to commit these violations. The path forward requires a continued shift from post-abuse remediation to proactive prevention. Therefore, the next phase of reform must focus on disrupting the illegal transfer of recruitment costs from employers to workers, establishing clear and enforceable joint liability for wages throughout multi-tier contracting chains, and strengthening retaliation protection for workers who file complaints to build trust in the system.

Introduction: Qatar's Labor Market Structure Qatar\u2019s economy is heavily reliant on expatriate workers, a characteristic shared by other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states [1]. Estimates suggest that while the total population of Qatar exceeds 2.8 million, Qatari nationals comprise only around 300,000 to 350,000 of these residents, equating to roughly 10\u201315% of the total population [1]. Consequently, the indigenous Qatari population constitutes a relatively small fraction of the overall workforce, with some studies indicating that citizens make up only about a quarter (or even less) of the national workforce [1]. This heavy dependence on expatriates is a defining feature of the labor market, where foreign workers fill roles ranging from unskilled labor to highly specialized managerial and technical positions.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fa3965fdabcd", "text": "This heavy dependence on expatriates is a defining feature of the labor market, where foreign workers fill roles ranging from unskilled labor to highly specialized managerial and technical positions.

Historically, this framework granted employers considerable Page 1 of 7 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 2nd, 2025 influence over the mobility and legal status of foreign workers. While Qatar has introduced reforms to enhance workers\u2019 rights and loosen some of these restrictions, enforcement gaps remain, particularly affecting lower-skilled or vulnerable migrant workers [2]. Efforts to localize the labor force, referred to collectively as \u201cQatarization,\u201d aim to increase the participation of Qatari nationals in both public and private sectors [1]. Nevertheless, different economic sectors exhibit varying degrees of success in implementing Qatarization initiatives, reflecting differences in skill requirements, competitive wage levels, and ongoing needs for specialized expertise. This report compares hiring practices across three major sectors in Qatar, energy, construction, and finance, to illustrate how each navigates the balance between national and expatriate talent, and the resulting implications for wages, skill transfer, and workforce development. 2.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6f26adbf1491", "text": "construction, and finance, to illustrate how each navigates the balance between national and expatriate talent, and the resulting implications for wages, skill transfer, and workforce development. 2. Sector Analysis: Comparing Hiring Practices This section explores three vital sectors in Qatar\u2019s economy, focusing on the composition of expatriate vs. national labor, wage structures, and the implications of these hiring patterns. Table 1 provides a high-level overview of the approximate proportion of Qatari and expatriate employees, skill requirements, and average wage ranges in each sector. Table 1.

Qatar is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of LNG, and revenues from hydrocarbons account for a substantial portion of the country\u2019s GDP, often cited at 40\u201350% or more in some years [2]. This has enabled Qatar to invest in cutting-edge technologies and large-scale industrial projects, including refineries, petrochemical complexes, and advanced offshore facilities. 1. Specialized Skill Requirements Page 2 of 7 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 2nd, 2025 The advanced nature of the energy industry frequently necessitates specialized knowledge in engineering, geosciences, project management, and complex technical operations. Due to the global shortage of experts with this level of specialization, multinational and state-owned enterprises (like QatarEnergy) actively recruit from the international market [1]. As a result, expatriates often occupy a substantial share of highly skilled and managerial positions. 2. Attracting and Retaining Global Talent The sector\u2019s wage levels are among the highest in Qatar (see Table 1).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c866c7306420", "text": "patriates often occupy a substantial share of highly skilled and managerial positions. 2. Attracting and Retaining Global Talent The sector\u2019s wage levels are among the highest in Qatar (see Table 1). These competitive salaries often include allowances for housing, transportation, and bonuses [2]. While local professionals also benefit from robust compensation packages, the demand for specialized competencies can surpass the supply of trained local talent. 3. Knowledge Transfer and Qatarization Despite efforts to increase Qatari participation, knowledge transfer programs vary widely in scope and effectiveness [1]. Some firms offer structured mentorship, but local skill- building still lags behind the sector\u2019s immediate needs. Collaborative programs between industry and educational institutions (e.g., Qatar University, Texas A&M University at Qatar) could facilitate faster development of local technical expertise. 4. Long-Term Sustainability As Qatar seeks to diversify its economy and reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, the energy sector\u2019s labor challenges, particularly around building local capacity, reflect a broader strategic concern. Strengthening local engineering and managerial roles remains crucial for adapting to the evolving global energy landscape.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b4afdcb4e6cf", "text": "cularly around building local capacity, reflect a broader strategic concern. Strengthening local engineering and managerial roles remains crucial for adapting to the evolving global energy landscape. 2.2 Construction Sector: Low- to Mid-Skilled Labor Between 2010 and 2022, the construction sector in Qatar witnessed extraordinary growth, driven by FIFA World Cup infrastructure projects and broader national development initiatives under Qatar National Vision 2030 [3]. This led to the rapid buildup of roads, stadiums, metro lines, airports, and other major facilities. 1. High Demand for Labor Construction remains labor-intensive, with migrant workers primarily from South Asia (e.g., India, Nepal, Bangladesh) comprising the bulk of the workforce [2]. Due to limited bargaining power, these workers can be vulnerable to exploitative practices, including delayed wages and excessive working hours. 2. Sponsorship System and Working Conditions The kafala system historically restricted movement for many lower-skilled laborers, complicating their ability to change employers or leave the country without specific approvals [2]. Although reforms have aimed at improving worker rights, such as partially abolishing the exit visa requirement, implementation gaps persist. International observers frequently raise concerns about health, safety, and living conditions in worker accommodations [3]. 3.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_56afc1371bb4", "text": "ially abolishing the exit visa requirement, implementation gaps persist. International observers frequently raise concerns about health, safety, and living conditions in worker accommodations [3]. 3. Wage Levels and Employment Terms Page 3 of 7 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 2nd, 2025 Wages within the construction sector are typically among the lowest in Qatar, ranging roughly from QAR 1,500 to QAR 5,000 per month (see Table 1) [2][3]. Overtime and bonus structures vary by employer. Despite recent improvements driven by global scrutiny during the World Cup, consistent enforcement of labor standards remains essential. 4. National vs. Expatriate Participation The physically demanding nature of construction work and relatively low pay render the sector less attractive for Qatari nationals [1]. Thus, expatriates account for over 85% of workers in this field (Table 1). Qatarization efforts here remain minimal in practice. 5. Post-World Cup Outlook With major event-related projects completed, new construction demand may slow. However, ongoing infrastructure maintenance and future development projects should sustain a need for foreign labor.

Ensuring ethical labor practices and consistent safety measures will be critical to safeguarding worker welfare and preserving Qatar\u2019s international reputation. 2.3 Finance Sector: A Blend of Local and International Professionals Though smaller than the hydrocarbons sector in absolute GDP contribution, Qatar\u2019s financial sector has experienced significant expansion, encompassing commercial banks, investment firms, insurance companies, and wealth management services. 1. Economic Diversification and Growth Qatar\u2019s commitment to diversifying beyond oil and gas has fueled the prominence of local financial institutions. The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) offers incentives for international financial services companies to establish offices in Doha, prompting demand for financial analysts, wealth managers, and other specialized professionals [1]. 2. Hiring Patterns Expatriates fill many high-level roles related to global investment banking, risk management, and niche financial products [2]. By contrast, Qatari nationals often occupy senior positions in government-linked banks and local financial institutions, reflecting both nationalization aims and established academic pathways (finance, business administration) [1]. Table 2 provides illustrative job roles and approximate workforce compositions within the finance sector. Table 2.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3229834b8bfa", "text": "ation aims and established academic pathways (finance, business administration) [1].

Wage Competitiveness The finance sector offers mid- to high-level compensation, ranging from QAR 8,000 for entry-level roles to well above QAR 25,000 for managerial or executive positions [1][2]. Additional benefits, such as housing allowances and performance-based bonuses, enhance the sector\u2019s overall attractiveness. 4. Qatarization and Career Development While the finance industry has a more balanced mix of expatriate and national staff than construction or energy, disparities in opportunities and salaries can persist.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-02", "series_number": 1, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 16, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q1_ EN_2025-01-02.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-02", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_59d89b05eeee", "text": "rization and Career Development While the finance industry has a more balanced mix of expatriate and national staff than construction or energy, disparities in opportunities and salaries can persist.

Long-Term Outlook Islamic banking, wealth management, and FinTech offer growth opportunities that will likely require both local and international expertise. Continued development of a stable regulatory environment and robust training pathways will be pivotal for retaining global talent while simultaneously advancing local workforce capabilities. 3. Regulatory Environment: Government Mandates and Qatarization The Qatari government has introduced a variety of initiatives aimed at increasing the employment of Qatari nationals, collectively known as \u201cQatarization\u201d [1]. These policies often include sector- specific targets or quotas, along with incentives or penalties to encourage compliance. Nevertheless, the extent to which such policies are enforced and the availability of qualified Qatari professionals differ widely across sectors. 1.

While Qatarization policies aim to enhance local workforce participation, their success depends on sector-specific factors, enforcement effectiveness, and the availability of qualified nationals [1]. To achieve a more equitable labor market, Qatar must continue refining its labor legislation, promoting transparent hiring practices, and implementing robust training initiatives for citizens. Ongoing research into wage disparities, skill development outcomes, and the overall effectiveness of nationalization mandates is crucial for crafting evidence-based strategies. By embracing a holistic approach, combining regulatory reforms, education, employer-led skill- building, and thorough data collection, Qatar can more effectively balance national and expatriate talent, securing a resilient and inclusive workforce for the future.

Introduction 1.1 Overview of Expatriate Turnover in Qatar Expatriate turnover, commonly defined as the rate at which foreign workers leave an organization or the host country, remains a foremost concern in Qatar. The Qatari economy relies heavily on foreign labor in diverse industries such as construction, energy, finance, hospitality, and services. According to the Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA), expatriates accounted for a labor force participation rate of approximately 95% for males and 57% for females among non-Qataris in 2023.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-12", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_90c0df1fcf57", "text": "ces. According to the Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA), expatriates accounted for a labor force participation rate of approximately 95% for males and 57% for females among non-Qataris in 2023. These figures underscore the vital role expatriates play in Qatar\u2019s active labor force and economic development (PSA, 2023). This reliance on expatriate labor highlights the urgency of addressing turnover to mitigate its impact on organizational operations and Qatar\u2019s broader developmental goals, including those outlined in the Qatar National Vision 2030. High turnover disrupts organizational continuity, increases recruitment and training costs, and may hinder the realization of these ambitious national objectives. 1.2 Significance of Studying Turnover in Qatar Qatar\u2019s rapid economic development, bolstered by major investments in infrastructure and energy, has made the country a hub for expatriate talent. Projects such as metro networks, stadiums for the FIFA World Cup 2022 (completed), and advancements in the LNG sector have significantly increased the demand for skilled foreign labor (Bashir. 2024; H\u00c4Zaq. 2024). Yet, a high turnover rate among expatriates can create disruptions across multiple dimensions: \u2022 Organizational Productivity: Continual attrition drains institutional knowledge and places additional strain on existing teams. \u2022 Economic Costs: Recruiting new expatriates involves considerable costs for visa processing, onboarding, and potential housing allowances.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-12", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5e8f035e2c48", "text": "l knowledge and places additional strain on existing teams. \u2022 Economic Costs: Recruiting new expatriates involves considerable costs for visa processing, onboarding, and potential housing allowances. \u2022 Human Capital Sustainability: From a macro perspective, excessive turnover can hamper the broader human development strategies put forth under national initiatives, such as Qatar National Vision 2030, which emphasize sustainable skill transfer to the local workforce. Page 2 of 15 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 12th, 2025 1.3 Relevance of Demographic Factors Demographic indicators, including age, educational qualifications, and gender, shape individuals\u2019 motivations, adaptability, and career trajectories. For instance, a young professional seeking rapid career progression may weigh opportunities dikerently than a mid-career worker with a family. Likewise, educational attainment can inform expectations regarding salary, job content, and progression pathways. Gender roles, in turn, intersect with socio-cultural norms and workplace policies, influencing experiences of professional growth and cultural adaptation. This report examines how each of these demographic factors uniquely contributes to expatriate turnover in Qatar. 2.

Key Demographics 2.1 Age Brackets 2.1.1 Younger Workforce (25\u201334) Research indicates that expatriates in the 25\u201334 age range prioritize career growth and opportunities for skill development. This demographic often exhibits higher geographical mobility due to fewer family obligations and is more likely to move if professional challenges and growth opportunities are lacking (Bashir. 2024; PwC, 2024). Between 2019 and 2023, turnover rates for this cohort rose sharply by 317%, from 0.65% to 2.72%, reflecting heightened dissatisfaction with career progression opportunities (Table 1). \u2022 Primary Motivations: Rapid skill acquisition, upward mobility, dynamic work experiences. \u2022 Retention Drivers: Competitive salaries, mentorship programs, and clear career pathways. \u2022 Key Finding: The tripling of turnover rates among younger workers since 2019 underscores a critical mismatch between their career expectations (e.g., rapid advancement) and available opportunities in Qatar\u2019s labor market (Table 1). 2.1.2 Mid-Career Professionals (35\u201344) Mid-career expatriates often seek job security, especially if they have family members residing with them in Qatar. This group values stable professional environments with supportive benefits, such as family-friendly policies, health insurance, and career growth opportunities. Additionally, they prioritize organizations that provide flexibility and long-term career stability, which significantly impacts their retention (H\u00c4Zaq.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-12", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_15506a861e12", "text": "th insurance, and career growth opportunities.

Their stay in Qatar depends on financial goals like retirement savings (Chaabna et al., 2018) and access to robust healthcare. Family needs, such as securing residency for dependents or reuniting with relatives, also play a role (Samir. 2024). Social integration challenges, including adapting to cultural norms, further influence retention (Bashir. 2024).

Drivers of Turnover While demographic factors shape the profile of expatriates in Qatar, several universal drivers heavily influence whether individuals choose to continue or end their assignments. 3.1 Salary Satisfaction Salary satisfaction consistently ranks as a pivotal factor in expatriate retention (Charterhouse, 2023). The Charterhouse report highlights that expatriates often evaluate their earnings and compensation packages, including allowances for housing, schooling, and medical coverage, in comparison to opportunities in their home countries or other competitive labor markets in the Gulf region.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-12", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 14, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0e8a70db03d1", "text": "compensation packages, including allowances for housing, schooling, and medical coverage, in comparison to opportunities in their home countries or other competitive labor markets in the Gulf region. Recent sectoral data underscores significant disparities in median salaries across Qatar\u2019s key industries, which correlate strongly with turnover rates (Table 4). \u2022 Data-Backed Insight: Expatriates in Qatar often cite salary as a significant factor influencing their decision to switch employers. Research from multiple sources, including Charterhouse (2023) and the PwC (2024), confirms that a substantial proportion of expatriates view better pay as a primary motivator for leaving their roles. This reflects the highly competitive nature of the Gulf labor market, where salary disparities across nationalities and skills play a critical role in shaping employee mobility. For example: Page 7 of 15 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 12th, 2025 - IT & Digital: Median salaries fell by 37% (4,800 QAR in 2019 \u2192 3,000 QAR in 2023), contributing to a 13.6% surge in turnover (17.7% \u2192 31.3%). - Health Services: A 13% increase in median salaries (3,000 QAR \u2192 3,386 QAR) aligned with a moderate rise in turnover (13.3% \u2192 21.7%), suggesting non-salary factors (e.g., workload) may also play a role.

Studies have shown that younger workers (25\u201334) and individuals with advanced degrees are particularly likely to leave if they perceive limited opportunities for growth or skill enhancement. Ewers et al. (2019) emphasize that structured career pathways and consistent professional development opportunities significantly enhance retention rates, particularly among highly mobile and skilled demographics. \u2022 Empirical Observations: Germany\u2019s experience with programs like \u201cTriple Win\u201d and vocational training initiatives highlights the impact of structured development ekorts.

Measures such as skill recognition, adaptive qualifications, and language training have proven ekective in enhancing retention and integration of skilled foreign workers (Schneider. 2023). 3.4 Cultural Adaptation and Background Integration into Qatari society, workplace culture, and social norms presents challenges for expatriates from diverse cultural backgrounds. Language barriers, religious practices, and dress codes often require adaptation to achieve successful integration (H\u00c4Zaq. 2024; Bashir. 2024). Expatriates originating from cultural backgrounds vastly dikerent from Qatar\u2019s, such as those from Europe or North America, frequently report dikiculties adjusting to local norms, contributing to higher turnover rates. For instance, Tunisian and Syrian expatriates face attrition rates of 40.8% and 31.0%, respectively, driven by cultural mismatches in workplace practices and social integration challenges (Table 5). Table 5. Cultural Adaptation Challenges and Turnover (2023) Nationality Turnover Rate (%) Avg.

Organizations should encourage face-to-face engagement opportunities to strengthen social cohesion among expatriates and local residents (H\u00c4Zaq. 2024). 3.6 Policy and Regulatory Factors Qatar\u2019s residency permits, sponsorship systems, and labor laws directly influence expatriate turnover. Understanding these regulations, such as the requirements for visa applications or sponsorship transfers, is essential for expatriates to navigate their stay in Qatar ekectively. Moreover, the sponsorship system significantly impacts job security and the ability to reunite with families. Streamlined regulatory frameworks could improve expatriates\u2019 satisfaction and retention (NATLEX, n.d.). 4. Impact on Organizations and Policy 4.1 Organizational Costs 4.1.1 Recruitment and Training High expatriate turnover generates cyclical recruitment processes that are both financially and time-intensive. Processes such as sponsorship, visa documentation, and relocation are highlighted as significant contributors to recruitment costs and time demands (ILO, 2022; NPC, 2023). For instance, micro-firms with fewer than 50 employees faced a 45.64% turnover rate in 2023, requiring the replacement of 217,548 workers annually at an estimated cost of QAR 1.09 billion (based on an average recruitment cost of QAR 5,000 per hire).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-12", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ed7851835e14", "text": "yees faced a 45.64% turnover rate in 2023, requiring the replacement of 217,548 workers annually at an estimated cost of QAR 1.09 billion (based on an average recruitment cost of QAR 5,000 per hire). Even large firms with over 500 employees, which had a lower turnover rate of 7.96%, spent QAR 185.5 million in 2023 to replace 37,099 departing expatriates (Table 6). These recurring costs strain organizational budgets, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like construction, where a 26.93% turnover rate might delay critical infrastructure projects, such as metro expansions (Table 6). To mitigate these burdens, policymakers could introduce targeted subsidies for micro- and small firms to okset recruitment expenses, alongside streamlined visa processing systems to reduce administrative delays. 4.1.2 Loss of Institutional Knowledge Departing expatriates take with them tacit knowledge of internal workflows, project histories, and client relationships. Rebuilding this knowledge base is time-consuming and impacts overall ekiciency. In the IT & Digital sector, which had a 31.28% turnover rate in 2023 (Table 4), the loss of specialized skills in software development and cybersecurity has been cited as a critical risk Page 10 of 15 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 12th, 2025 to project continuity (Irfan et al., 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-12", "series_number": 2, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q2_EN_2025-01-12-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ba0b6340cbf1", "text": "oftware development and cybersecurity has been cited as a critical risk Page 10 of 15 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 12th, 2025 to project continuity (Irfan et al., 2024). Similarly, the healthcare sector, with a 21.70% turnover rate, faces challenges in maintaining care continuity as new stak require several months to acclimate to specialized workflows (Table 4). The manufacturing sector, experiencing 20.97% turnover, considered increased production downtime as replacements struggled to master complex operational protocols (Table 4). Addressing these challenges requires sector-specific strategies, such as mandatory knowledge- transfer protocols for departing employees in high-skill industries. Table 6.

Conclusion This report underscores the intricate interplay between demographic factors such as age, education, and gender, and broader systemic elements like salary structures, living conditions, career progression opportunities, and cultural adaptation in shaping expatriate turnover in Qatar. High turnover rates pose significant challenges by disrupting organizational continuity, escalating recruitment and training costs, and eroding institutional knowledge. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that aligns with Qatar\u2019s overarching development goals and its vision for a sustainable, diversified economy. Key Takeaways: 1.

A renewed emphasis on social integration and cultural adaptation, such as Arabic language training and mentorship programs, will further enhance expatriates\u2019 sense of belonging. By embedding these priorities into national development frameworks, Qatar can cultivate a resilient, inclusive labor market that supports economic diversification and knowledge transfer. Ultimately, the success of these ekorts depends on aligning workforce strategies with the transformative objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030. Through collaboration between policymakers, employers, and international partners, Qatar can solidify its position as a global hub for talent, innovation, and sustainable growth. 6. References 1.

Introduction 1.1 Overview of Qatar\u2019s Expatriate Labor Market Qatar\u2019s unparalleled economic growth has been underpinned by its reliance on expatriate labor, which, according to the latest statistics, accounts for approximately 89.5% of the population, reflecting a steady increase in reliance on foreign workers for critical economic functions (NPC. n.d., Sukoco. 2024). This workforce is vital for the nation\u2019s economic goals, driving industries such as energy, construction, healthcare, and technology (Sweeney. 2024). As the world\u2019s top exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Qatar has invested heavily in infrastructure projects, including those developed for the successful hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which showcased the nation\u2019s capacity for innovation and large-scale planning, while setting the stage for continued economic diversification (Bloomberg. 2024). The labor market in Qatar is governed by the Qatar Labor Law, which has undergone significant reforms in recent years. These reforms focus on improving worker mobility and autonomy, including the elimination of exit permits for most workers (Abdullah. 2014, ILO. 2024, Sweeney.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_303db8c9d14d", "text": "one significant reforms in recent years. These reforms focus on improving worker mobility and autonomy, including the elimination of exit permits for most workers (Abdullah. 2014, ILO. 2024, Sweeney. 2024, GCO. 2025). In August 2023 alone, over 153,000 workers successfully transferred to new employers, showing the continued implementation of these reforms (Salari. 2023). According to the IOM's World Migration Report 2024, migration is a global phenomenon where the majority of people move within their own countries. However, international migration patterns are diverse, with a considerable proportion of individuals migrating for work, family, or education (IOM. 2024). Table 1.

For example, the 2024 agreement with Kenya aims to triple the number of skilled Kenyan workers in Qatar, targeting key sectors and ensuring fair treatment and protection for workers (Murimi. 2024, Babassa. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5aae13c27a56", "text": "the 2024 agreement with Kenya aims to triple the number of skilled Kenyan workers in Qatar, targeting key sectors and ensuring fair treatment and protection for workers (Murimi. 2024, Babassa. 2024). Qatar\u2019s foreign policy also emphasizes attracting and retaining expatriate labor from diverse global regions, including South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe. This approach not only addresses labor shortages but also strengthens Qatar\u2019s position as a global hub for skilled professionals. Initiatives like the Qatar Visa Centres and the National Strategy for an EXective and Highly Productive Workforce (2024-2030) further support this goal by streamlining recruitment processes and enhancing labor market eXiciency (GCO. 2025, Qatar Tribune. 2024). These eXorts underscore Qatar\u2019s commitment to creating a stable and inclusive environment for expatriate workers, ensuring the country\u2019s continued economic growth and development. 3.2 Visa Reforms and Labor Rights Enhancements Recent reforms have strengthened Qatar\u2019s labor environment: \u2022 Introduction of a universal minimum wage: In 2021, Qatar introduced a non- discriminatory minimum wage of QAR 1,000 per month, with additional allowances for accommodation (QAR 500) and food (QAR 300) if not provided by the employer.

Future Outlook 4.1 Intra-GCC Reconciliation and Regional Integration The Al-Ula Agreement, signed in January 2021, continues to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties between Qatar and its GCC neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt. Recent developments, such as the Qatari-UAE oXicial delegations meeting in Abu Dhabi in September 2024, highlight ongoing eXorts to implement the Al-Ula Declaration and enhance Page 9 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 21th, 2025 regional cooperation.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 23, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_00cf4cb43df8", "text": "bi in September 2024, highlight ongoing eXorts to implement the Al-Ula Declaration and enhance Page 9 of 27 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 21th, 2025 regional cooperation. These discussions focus on mechanisms to restore traditional labor corridors and facilitate the movement of workers, reducing disruptions caused by the 2017 blockade (General Secretariat of the Gulf Cooperation Council. 2024, MOFA. 2024). Qatar\u2019s role as a mediator in regional conflicts, combined with its commitment to GCC integration, enhances its credibility and stability in the region. This positions Qatar as an attractive destination for skilled labor, particularly as traditional labor corridors re-open and regional collaboration deepens (MOFA. 2024). 4.2 Global Talent Competition As neighboring GCC nations enhance labor reforms to attract global talent, Qatar continues to oXer competitive incentives to maintain its position as a progressive labor hub. Recent initiatives, such as capital funds and growth opportunities in sectors like healthcare, technology, and renewable energy, have attracted foreign professionals seeking stable and lucrative employment (The Peninsula Qatar. 2025c).

These eXorts align with Qatar\u2019s goal of becoming a regional leader in innovation and economic diversification, ensuring a steady inflow of global talent (Invest Qatar. n.d., GCO. 2008). 4.3 Sustainability and Worker Welfare Ongoing reforms in housing, wages, and legal protections remain critical to sustaining Qatar\u2019s labor market attractiveness. The introduction of a non-discriminatory minimum wage, the abolition of the No-Objection Certificate (NOC) requirement, and the establishment of the Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund are notable steps toward improving worker welfare (FIFA, n.d., Amnesty International. n.d.). However, organizations like Amnesty International have highlighted the need for sustained improvements, particularly in addressing wage theft, ensuring fair working conditions, and maintaining the positive legacy of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Continued collaboration with international bodies like the ILO will be essential to achieving these goals (Amnesty International. 2022, ILO. 2024). 5.

This section analyzes workforce responses to these disruptions using LMIS data, with a focus on job loss volumes, sectoral and regional vulnerabilities, and diXerential impacts by nationality. Each subsection integrates visual evidence to highlight patterns of resilience and structural exposure. 5.2.1 Scale and Composition of Workforce Exits The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more than three times the job losses observed during the blockade period, with total workforce exits rising from approximately 225,000 to over 700,000. The job loss rate increased from 15.3 percent to 28.4 percent, while total turnover climbed from 21.8 percent to 40.4 percent.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 29, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1a0e0d6a9624", "text": "total workforce exits rising from approximately 225,000 to over 700,000. The job loss rate increased from 15.3 percent to 28.4 percent, while total turnover climbed from 21.8 percent to 40.4 percent. These shifts reflect the unprecedented disruption to global mobility and domestic operations caused by the pandemic compared to the more regionally contained nature of the blockade. A striking observation across both crisis periods is the stability in the ratio of job losses to overall turnover, which remained close to 70 percent. This consistency points to entrenched employer behaviors during economic contractions: a preference for large-scale layoXs as the primary means of workforce adjustment. Rather than adopting more adaptive responses - such as internal redeployment, flexible work arrangements, or short-term contracts - many employers relied on direct terminations, facilitated by low separation costs and a labor framework centered on employer control. This dynamic illustrates a core limitation in labor market flexibility. While the scale of disruption diXered between the two crises, the mechanism of response remained largely unchanged. The structure of employment contracts, limited redundancy protections, and rigid sectoral labor channels leave little room for countercyclical labor policy or negotiated adjustment strategies.

Similarly, healthcare, food services, and agriculture emerged among the top five impacted sectors during both crises. These trends illustrate how diXerent types of crises interact with sector-specific vulnerabilities. While the blockade mainly disrupted externally dependent sectors linked to regional trade, the pandemic undermined internal service delivery, physical operations, and consumer-facing roles. This broader exposure profile indicates that Qatar\u2019s labor market is highly sensitive not only to geopolitical events but also to global disruptions that interrupt project flows, worker mobility, and local demand.

Nigerians consistently appeared among the most aXected, with loss rates of 369 per 1,000 workers during the blockade and 530 per 1,000 during the pandemic. For Moroccans, the pandemic represented a first major shock, placing them among the top three most aXected groups despite their limited exposure during the blockade. These patterns reflect more than random variation. They indicate structural risk profiles shaped by nationality, with distinct clustering in occupations, employment arrangements, and industry assignments. For example, Egyptians, who are employed across construction, transport, and logistics, saw job loss rates increase from 147 to 321 per 1,000 workers between the two crises. The data suggest that while Egyptian workers were not entirely marginalized by the blockading countries, they faced increased exposure to risk under unstable diplomatic conditions. In broader terms, nationality has become a proxy for employment risk in Qatar\u2019s segmented labor market.

The section is organized into four thematic subsections, each highlighting key findings supported by visual evidence. 5.3.1 Transfer Volume vs. Mobility Rate: Interpreting the Divergence While the total number of job transfers surged after the 2020 labor reform, increasing from approximately 51,000 to nearly 480,000, the mobility rate - defined as job transfers relative to the total expatriate labor force - declined from 0.0034% to 0.0021%. This apparent contradiction is primarily due to the substantial growth in the overall labor force during the same period, as Qatar\u2019s economy recovered and hiring resumed across sectors. As a result, although job changes rose in absolute terms, they accounted for a smaller share of a larger workforce. This divergence also reflects transitional implementation dynamics.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 34, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1d37feac5c25", "text": "across sectors.

Initial administrative hurdles, gaps in awareness, and uneven employer readiness may have tempered early uptake despite the policy change. In parallel, statistical volatility during the pandemic complicates direct comparisons with earlier baselines. The post-reform surge in job transfers also coincided with a broader recovery in expatriate labor inflows, as hiring resumed across sectors following both the COVID-19 downturn and easing of regional tensions. This expansion in the labor pool underscores how mobility reforms not only influenced internal job switching but also reshaped the volume and composition of new foreign worker entries. Crucially, a lower mobility rate should not be interpreted as reform failure. Rather, it may represent a phase of stabilization in which job switching becomes more intentional and aligned with sector-specific dynamics. The broader picture - rising transfer volumes coupled with a declining mobility rate - suggests that reforms have successfully unlocked worker mobility, but institutional and behavioral shifts are progressing more gradually.

Internal LMIS data show that the most significant increases in job transfers were concentrated among workers from Asia and the Middle East. In particular, expatriates from former blockading countries such as Egypt and Jordan registered sharp rises in job change activity. For example, transfer volumes for several Asian nationalities more than doubled in the post-reform period. In contrast, Western expatriates demonstrated far more stable patterns of job movement. Although this group is generally concentrated in higher-skilled and higher-paid roles, the data show little to no growth in transfer activity after the reform. This divergence likely reflects structural diXerences in labor market dynamics. Workers from Asia and the Middle East may have previously faced more rigid constraints under the former NOC system, whereas Western professionals may have already enjoyed more mobility or occupied longer-term, contract-based roles with greater employment stability. These trends point to a segmented labor market response. The most substantial improvements in labor flexibility were concentrated among mid- and lower-skilled expatriates who historically faced barriers to mobility. The data suggest that the reform was particularly eXective in enabling job transitions among groups that had previously lacked such options.

Reference Source: Ministry of Labour (LMIS) 5.3.3 Within-Sector vs. Cross-Sector Mobility The reform influenced not only whether expatriates could change jobs, but also how they moved between sectors. LMIS data indicate a modest increase in the share of job transfers that occurred within the same sector, rising from 36.6 percent before the reform to 37.0 percent afterward. Although the shift is small, it is noteworthy in the context of broader labor mobility patterns. This rise in same-sector transfers suggests that many expatriates sought improved conditions or opportunities within familiar occupational domains. Rather than seeking entirely new roles, these workers likely aimed to leverage their existing skills and sectoral experience. For employers, this behavior signals greater intra-sector competition for talent, particularly in fields such as construction, hospitality, and healthcare where job roles are often standardized and skills are readily transferrable.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 38, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_bed1ad12f810", "text": "nals greater intra-sector competition for talent, particularly in fields such as construction, hospitality, and healthcare where job roles are often standardized and skills are readily transferrable. At the same time, cross-sector mobility continues to dominate. This indicates that although restrictions on employer change have eased, deeper structural frictions - such as gaps in certification, industry-specific experience, or diXerences in sectoral demand - still shape the patterns of job transitions. These factors may also explain why the share of cross-sector moves remains high even after reform. From a policy standpoint, the increase in same-sector transitions reflects an expansion of worker agency without destabilizing existing sectoral employment structures. This provides a foundation for targeted upskilling and career advancement pathways within specific industries. Table 6.

Its application in tracking changes related to the No-Objection Certificate, visa reform, and sectoral shifts allows ministries to make timely and targeted decisions. These capabilities are central to realizing the human capital priorities of NDS3. In short, while public data enables broad trend analysis, LMIS provides the operational detail necessary to inform adaptive, evidence-based governance. 5.5 Strategic Relevance of LMIS Data for Policy and Governance The insights drawn from the Ministry of Labour\u2019s LMIS datasets highlight the critical value of internal administrative data in advancing evidence-based workforce governance.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-21", "series_number": 3, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 41, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q3_EN_2025-01-21-with-Data3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-21", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6b219d15b807", "text": "for Policy and Governance The insights drawn from the Ministry of Labour\u2019s LMIS datasets highlight the critical value of internal administrative data in advancing evidence-based workforce governance.

Conclusion This report has examined how Qatar\u2019s expatriate labor market has responded to major disruptions and structural reforms, integrating new insights drawn from the Ministry of Labour\u2019s LMIS datasets. The updated findings reveal deeper patterns of mobility, sectoral resilience, and demographic disparities that were not visible in public data sources alone.

It strengthens accountability and helps align implementation with Qatar's NDS3 objectives. Going forward, the strategic use of internal administrative data must remain central to Qatar\u2019s labor market governance.

This growth has resulted in a significant influx of expatriate workers, leading to a highly diverse population. As of 2024, Qatar's total population stands at approximately 3.06 million, with expatriates comprising nearly 88.4% of this figure (Qatar Open Data Portal. 2025; GMI Research Team. 2024). Recognizing the importance of social cohesion, the Qatar National Vision 2030 emphasizes community integration as a key element for long-term stability and economic productivity (GSDP. 2008; GCO. n.d.b). To support expatriates, various initiatives have been developed to enhance social inclusion. Programs such as Hoops for All, a basketball initiative fostering unity through sports, reflect efforts to strengthen social networks (FIBA. 2025; Bloom Qatar. n.d.). Additionally, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology\u2019s Digital Inclusion Index Report 2024 highlights the growing reliance on online platforms for essential services, employment, and cultural guidance (MCIT. 2025b; MCIT. 2025c). Platforms like QatarStalk and Expat.com serve as vital resources for expatriates navigating life in Qatar (Mty.2023b; Team QT. 2024a).

Social and ethnic networks provide crucial support, offering practical assistance and fostering a sense of belonging in an increasingly multicultural environment. 1.2 Significance of Studying Social and Ethnic Networks Building on the significance of social and ethnic networks, Qatar\u2019s social integration policies under the Qatar National Vision 2030 aim to create cohesive communities among its diverse population. Launched in 2008, this vision balances economic growth with human and natural resource sustainability (NPC. n.d.; GCO. n.d.b): \u2022 National Development Strategies: The Qatar National Vision 2030 is implemented through successive National Development Strategies, including the First (2011-2016), Second (2018-2022), and the upcoming Third (2024-2030), each focusing on equity, cohesion, and collective well-being (GCO. n.d.d). \u2022 Infrastructure and Urban Connectivity: Large-scale projects such as Metro Doha and Lusail improve mobility and safety, creating better opportunities for social interaction and strengthening the integration of diverse communities (GCO. n.d.c).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b38fde6880a1", "text": "e-scale projects such as Metro Doha and Lusail improve mobility and safety, creating better opportunities for social interaction and strengthening the integration of diverse communities (GCO. n.d.c). \u2022 Digital Transformation and Inclusion: Initiatives like the Digital Inclusion Index 2024 and the SANADY platform streamline aid coordination and provide equitable access to social and digital services, ensuring community engagement extends into virtual spaces (MCIT. 2025b; GCO. 2025; MSDF. 2025a). \u2022 Network Analysis and Policy Design: Mapping and analyzing social interactions within expatriate networks provide policymakers with deeper insights into community needs, strengthening national strategies for social cohesion and inclusion (MCIT. 2025a; CRA. 2024). \u2022 Digital Innovation and Engagement: Programs under the Digital Agenda 2030 and National Digital Authentication and Trust Services Strategy reinforce Qatar's commitment to building a connected, secure, and digitally empowered society (MCIT. 2025a; Invest Qatar. 2022). By integrating these policies, Qatar is fostering an inclusive, resilient society where social and ethnic networks remain fundamental to community well-being. These strategies align with the country\u2019s goal of balancing cultural heritage with modernization, ensuring that both citizens and expatriates benefit from sustainable, long-term development (Amiri Diwan. n.d.; MCIT. 2025b; NPC. n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_39f8c85237b3", "text": "ntry\u2019s goal of balancing cultural heritage with modernization, ensuring that both citizens and expatriates benefit from sustainable, long-term development (Amiri Diwan. n.d.; MCIT. 2025b; NPC. n.d.). 1.3 Relevance of Geopolitical and Economic Context The geopolitical and economic landscape of Qatar significantly shapes its social and ethnic networks, impacting how communities integrate, retain members, and develop policies. \u2022 Energy Sector and Economic Resilience: Qatar is one of the wealthiest nations per capita, with natural gas reserves comprising two-thirds of its GDP and 80% of export earnings. Strategic export ties with countries such as Japan, South Korea, India, and China help cushion the effects of regional sanctions, maintaining economic stability (Lloyds Bank. n.d.; Qatar Chamber. 2019).

The country navigates complex relations with regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran to maintain stability and economic growth (Kawakibi. 2022). \u2022 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Relations: Qatar\u2019s role in the GCC remains pivotal for its economic and social policies. Since the resolution of the 2017 Gulf crisis, strengthened diplomatic and economic ties with GCC neighbors have boosted labor mobility, investments, and regional projects. The GCC Economic Unity framework has facilitated trade liberalization and investment flows, promoting deeper economic integration (GCC. 2024B; Times of Oman. 2025; MBG. 2024). Additionally, Qatar\u2019s participation in joint security initiatives, including military cooperation and intelligence- sharing, reinforces regional stability (GCC. 2024a; MOFA. 2024). \u2022 Investment and Workforce Integration: The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with assets estimated at approximately $526 billion as of November 2024, strategically invests in technology, artificial intelligence, healthcare, real estate, and infrastructure to diversify Qatar\u2019s economy and strengthen its workforce development. By channeling natural gas revenues into these sectors, QIA plays a key role in ensuring long-term economic stability and global economic positioning (IFSWF.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_64e52d136f1c", "text": "and strengthen its workforce development.

Qatar's economic and geopolitical positioning fosters a multicultural society where social and ethnic networks serve as critical pillars of integration. These networks enhance workforce stability, promote social cohesion, and contribute to economic sustainability.

These insights are particularly useful for understanding the effects of recent labor reforms, including the removal of the No-Objection Certificate (NOC) requirement and the introduction of Page 4 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 30th, 2025 more flexible visa pathways. By comparing job mobility rates before and after these reforms, the report highlights patterns of labor segmentation and variation in job-switching behavior across regions. This includes higher mobility rates in construction and logistics among some Asian and African nationalities, and more stable employment patterns among Western expatriates. 2.

This hiring trend is especially prominent in construction, hospitality, and domestic labor sectors, where informal referrals are often considered more reliable than traditional recruitment processes (Team QT. 2024b; GO-Globe. 2023). \u2022 Professional Skill Training & Workshops: Some expatriate communities organize skill development programs, such as language courses, certification classes, and r\u00e9sum\u00e9- writing workshops, enhancing members\u2019 employability (Qatar OFW. n.d.a.; MCIT. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_350b5be493ee", "text": "iate communities organize skill development programs, such as language courses, certification classes, and r\u00e9sum\u00e9- writing workshops, enhancing members\u2019 employability (Qatar OFW. n.d.a.; MCIT. 2024). \u2022 Legal and Employment Guidance: Networks also help expatriates navigate Qatar\u2019s evolving labor laws, ensuring compliance with work permit regulations and dispute resolution mechanisms (GCO. n.d.e). Page 10 of 35 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team January 30th, 2025 These informal yet structured channels not only accelerate job placements but also help employers reduce hiring risks, leading to more enicient workforce integration. 3.2 Housing Assistance Finding affordable and suitable housing can be a challenge for newly arrived expatriates. Social networks play a crucial role in easing this transition. \u2022 Community-Based Housing Networks: Many expatriate groups maintain online platforms and WhatsApp groups where members share rental listings, recommend landlords, and provide firsthand experiences about accommodations (Qatar OFW. n.d.b.). \u2022 Shared Housing & Cost-Saving Strategies: Some communities arrange group accommodations to reduce living expenses, a common practice among South Asian and African workers (Mty.2023a). \u2022 Tenant Rights Awareness: Networks provide guidance on rental laws, ensuring members are aware of their rights regarding security deposits, eviction notices, and dispute resolution (Bose. 2024; The Peninsula. 2024c).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_7f0fc537548d", "text": "areness: Networks provide guidance on rental laws, ensuring members are aware of their rights regarding security deposits, eviction notices, and dispute resolution (Bose. 2024; The Peninsula. 2024c). By reducing housing insecurity, these networks increase expatriates\u2019 stability and reduce turnover rates, benefiting both workers and employers. 3.3 Cultural Orientation and Social Support Living in a new country involves navigating cultural differences, bureaucratic processes, and legal frameworks. Social and ethnic networks act as mentorship platforms that help newcomers adjust to life in Qatar. \u2022 Mentorship Programs & Buddy Systems: Established expatriates often mentor newcomers, guiding them on local customs, laws, and workplace etiquette (Ali et al. 2012; El-Ekhteyar and Furlan. 2016). \u2022 Workshops on Local Culture & Norms: Community-led sessions educate expatriates on Qatari social customs, gender roles, and public behavior expectations to prevent misunderstandings (Gypsy Warrior. 2024). \u2022 Legal and Bureaucratic Assistance: Networks assist with navigating residency applications, health insurance registration, and banking procedures, ensuring smoother transitions (MCIT. 2025b). These support mechanisms reduce culture shock and create a more inclusive environment for expatriates. 3.4 Fostering Community Cohesion and Retention Beyond practical support, social and ethnic networks offer emotional stability, contributing to higher retention rates among expatriate workers.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2ca76ed31bd7", "text": "riates. 3.4 Fostering Community Cohesion and Retention Beyond practical support, social and ethnic networks offer emotional stability, contributing to higher retention rates among expatriate workers.

Policy Considerations: Leveraging Community Networks Recognizing the significance of social and ethnic networks, policymakers in Qatar are working toward inclusive governance, labor market reforms, and digital connectivity to improve expatriate integration. 4.1 Government Engagement & Policy Initiatives The Qatari government has introduced several programs and reforms aimed at enhancing expatriate well-being and fostering community inclusion. These initiatives align with the broader goals of Qatar National Vision 2030, which emphasizes social cohesion, economic diversification, and sustainable development. 4.1.1 National Integration Programs Launched in 2008 under His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s National Vision 2030 focuses on four pillars: Human Development, Social Development, Economic Development, and Environmental Development (GCO. n.d.b; Council of Ministers Secretariat General. n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 30, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_9271a76392ec", "text": "National Vision 2030 focuses on four pillars: Human Development, Social Development, Economic Development, and Environmental Development (GCO. n.d.b; Council of Ministers Secretariat General. n.d.).

Qatar Labor Market Data: Ministry of Labor Insights This section is designed to enhance the sociological framing of this report, \"Social and Ethnic Networks in Qatar: A Sociological Overview of Community Integration, Retention, and Policy Implications.\" All data interpretations and visuals are provided with the goal of reinforcing the report\u2019s central argument: that labor market behaviors in Qatar are shaped not solely by formal institutions, but also by informal social networks, regional affiliations, and policy accessibility. As such, the insights presented here should be understood not merely as descriptive labor metrics, but as manifestations of deeper social structures governing inclusion, opportunity, and stability for expatriate communities in Qatar.

This section presents new insights derived from internal Ministry of Labor datasets that track labor mobility, tenure, compensation, and sectoral turnover in Qatar. These data-driven findings strengthen the report\u2019s sociological analysis of social and ethnic networks by providing empirical evidence of how community affiliation, labor policies, and sector-specific dynamics influence workforce behavior. In particular, we examine how the abolition of the No-Objection Certificate (NOC), expanded visa pathways, and labor reforms between 2019 and 2023 reshaped the expatriate labor market\u2014especially for lower- and mid-skilled workers from Asia and Africa. In synthesizing this data, it remains essential to uphold the report\u2019s original purpose: to explore how integration and community bonds shape not only job mobility but long-term retention and social positioning within Qatari society. Thus, the labor market analysis here serves to illuminate broader questions of social inclusion, marginalization, and access to opportunity. 5.1 Sectoral Turnover Trends: Structural Instability and Reform Exposure Turnover rates varied dramatically by sector over the reform timeline.

This pattern suggests that reform-driven mobility\u2014combined with pandemic-related uncertainty\u2014enabled significant worker reshuffling. By contrast, Education and Health Services demonstrated greater stability, likely due to stricter licensing and professional requirements that moderate mobility. Figure 1.

Notably, even Financial Services\u2014a relatively high- paying sector\u2014shows elevated turnover, indicating that compensation alone does not guarantee retention. Instead, access to networks, job security, and social familiarity appear to play larger roles in shaping long-term attachment to the workplace. Figure 2.

By linking nationality to sector-specific dynamics, this breakdown reveals patterns of occupational clustering that are often reinforced through social networks, recruitment pipelines, and labor demand. For instance, certain nationalities dominate in construction or logistics due to historical recruitment channels and visa eligibility trends. These insights help explain why some groups experience higher turnover or shorter tenure\u2014not simply due to sectoral volatility, but because of how nationality interacts with access, retention mechanisms, and perceived career pathways. Importantly, the dataset reveals a notable regional bias, with Asian and African nationalities overrepresented among mobile and lower-wage roles, while Western European nationalities are underrepresented or entirely absent in mobility data\u2014suggesting stable, higher-tier placements and less exposure to job-switching reforms.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 44, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c427064e644c", "text": "d lower-wage roles, while Western European nationalities are underrepresented or entirely absent in mobility data\u2014suggesting stable, higher-tier placements and less exposure to job-switching reforms. These disparities are further underscored when viewed in relation to salary data: Western expatriates tend to occupy higher-compensated roles in finance, consulting, and education, while workers from lower-income countries tend to concentrate in physically demanding, lower-paid roles, which also correspond to sectors with higher turnover (Figure 3). Figure 3 demonstrates stark differences in average tenure across nationalities. Workers from Palestine, Yemen, and Jordan maintain the longest tenures, often exceeding 2,000 days, likely reflecting tight-knit community networks and more permanent forms of settlement. In contrast, Tunisians and Syrians exhibit short average tenures and high turnover, pointing to weaker institutional or informal retention mechanisms. Figure 3. Average Tenure by Nationality (2023) Reference Source: Ministry of Labour (LMIS). Complementing this, Figure 4 shows that turnover rates are highest among Sudanese, Tunisian, and Syrian workers\u2014reinforcing the report\u2019s earlier claims that national origin significantly shapes labor continuity and vulnerability to churn.

Drawing on the updated LMIS dataset (Table 4), we observe significant reform-induced variation in job mobility rates. The highest mobility shifts occurred among workers from Asia and Africa, particularly in sectors such as Construction, Logistics, and Services. For example, Bangladeshi workers in Construction increased their job mobility rate from 1.25% pre-reform to 2.72% post-reform. Similarly, Nepali workers in Logistics and Services more than doubled their mobility, from 0.84% to 1.85%. Among African nationalities, Egyptians working in Building and Construction exhibited an extraordinary jump\u2014from 0.08% to 1.07%\u2014indicating both prior structural constraints and a high latent demand for job transitions once those constraints were removed. In contrast, job mobility among Western expatriates remains marginal. The top three Western nationalities by mobility rate were United Kingdom (0.024%), Canada (0.006%), and France (0.005%).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 46, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2c1c5e54a71d", "text": "removed. In contrast, job mobility among Western expatriates remains marginal. The top three Western nationalities by mobility rate were United Kingdom (0.024%), Canada (0.006%), and France (0.005%). For example, Canadian workers in Logistics and Services recorded a mobility rate of just 0.0062% post-reform. These figures suggest that Western expatriates typically occupy roles with high contractual stability, pre-negotiated benefits, and employer-facilitated mobility, thereby remaining largely insulated from the structural challenges that prompted the reform. It is also worth noting that the absolute number of Western workers in the dataset is relatively small compared to Asian or African nationalities, which further limits the observed mobility figures. Their low representation may reflect a structural bias in recruitment flows and occupational segmentation, rather than simply the absence of job-switching behavior. These contrasting outcomes reveal that reforms have created opportunities where social and administrative barriers previously suppressed job switching\u2014especially in labor-intensive, low- wage sectors staffed predominantly by workers from Asia and Africa.

Yet, their long-term stability continues to rely on ethnic networks, informal support systems, and perceived opportunity structures within specific sectors. What sets the internal LMIS data apart from publicly available sources is not just the level of detail, but the analytical power it unlocks. Public data, such as figures from labor force surveys or aggregate employment snapshots, often lack the granularity needed to assess reform outcomes, labor segmentation, or community-specific behaviors. They typically exclude disaggregation by nationality, sector, and time period, making it nearly impossible to isolate the effects of policies like the NOC and Visa reform or sector-specific turnover. By contrast, LMIS data allows for targeted analysis across reform phases (pre- vs. post-reform), enabling policymakers to assess differential impacts on various national groups and to understand how sectoral structures mediate labor mobility.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-01-30", "series_number": 4, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 50, "total_chunks": 79, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q4_EN_2025-01-30-with-Data.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-01-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_abd5ce07b062", "text": "analysis across reform phases (pre- vs. post-reform), enabling policymakers to assess differential impacts on various national groups and to understand how sectoral structures mediate labor mobility.

Conclusion Social and ethnic networks are indispensable to the expatriate experience in Qatar, acting as critical infrastructure for integration, support, and community building within its diverse population. These networks deliver essential services\u2014from facilitating job placements and securing housing to providing cultural orientation and vital emotional support\u2014significantly enhancing the well-being and social cohesion of Qatar\u2019s expatriate communities. In a dynamic geopolitical and economic environment, these networks are pivotal in shaping migration patterns, supporting expatriates through various transitions, and fostering a resilient multicultural society. The 2017 blockade, for example, highlighted the adaptability and importance of these networks in mitigating labor market disruptions and ensuring community stability.

Introduction 1.1 Overview of Nationality-Based Compensation Discrepancies Salary packages in Qatar, similar to other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries with substantial expatriate workforces (ChaadHR. 2023b; Team QT. 2024b), often exhibit variations based on employees\u2019 nationalities (Qatar Visa Check. 2025b). These discrepancies arise from a combination of factors: \u2022 Skill Shortages: The demand for specialized skills not readily available locally compels companies to recruit international talent. \u2022 Cultural Expectations: Diverse cultural backgrounds influence compensation structures and benefit expectations. \u2022 Established Compensation Norms: Traditional practices link compensation levels to nationality, particularly for expatriates. Compensation disparities in Qatar are heavily influenced by nationality, with Western expatriates often receiving significantly higher salaries and benefits compared to local employees and non- Western expatriates (The Peninsula. 2021; TimeCamp. n.d.; Statista Research Department. 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_14306444fa4c", "text": "atriates often receiving significantly higher salaries and benefits compared to local employees and non- Western expatriates (The Peninsula. 2021; TimeCamp. n.d.; Statista Research Department. 2022). For example, Western CEOs in Qatar earn an average of USD 40,700 per month, including housing, transportation, and comprehensive health insurance, while Asian expatriates in similar roles earn approximately USD 33,000 monthly with fewer benefits (Statista Research Department. 2022); Qatari nationals, representing 10\u201315% of the workforce, earn an average of QAR 16,380 (USD 4,500) per month, significantly higher than the expatriate average of QAR 4,732 (USD 1,300), a diherence widened by government subsidies and free public healthcare for locals (SAAKIN. n.d.b.). Housing allowances further benefit Western expatriates, who spend an average of 34.16% of income on rent, typically covered by employer-sponsored housing (GO-Globe. 2024). Additionally, Western expatriates receive highly attractive compensation packages, including relocation support, accommodation, child education benefits, and private health insurance exceeding mandatory coverage for other expatriates (Aetna International. n.d.; Valentine. 2025). These enhanced benefits can be crucial for attracting specialized talent, particularly in industries reliant on international labor (Rivermate. n.d.; HRM Handbook.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b144d4e2be09", "text": "ernational. n.d.; Valentine. 2025). These enhanced benefits can be crucial for attracting specialized talent, particularly in industries reliant on international labor (Rivermate. n.d.; HRM Handbook. n.d.), but they also contribute to increased overall labor costs and may lead to disparities that negatively ahect workplace morale and perceptions of fairness (Generis Global Legal Services. 2024). Industries like construction, finance, energy, and technology in Qatar, heavily reliant on international labor, exhibit significant compensation disparities based on nationality and origin (Team QT. 2024b). In the construction sector, many South Asian workers earn close to the Page 2 of 25 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team February 22th, 2025 minimum wage, which was QAR 1,000 per month plus allowances for food and accommodation as of 2023 (ILO. 2023), with some reports indicating even lower wages for undocumented workers (Ochieng. 2024). In contrast, Western expatriates in construction and other sectors typically receive substantially higher salaries and comprehensive benefit packages, including housing allowances, transportation, and other perks (Qatar Living. 2014; ChaadHR. 2023b).

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights that Qatar\u2019s state-led growth model, while ehective, requires reforms to diversify revenue and enhance spending ehiciency to maintain fiscal prudence amidst such costs (IMF. 2024a). Balancing competitive compensation with cost ehiciency is essential for long-term economic stability, as outlined in Qatar\u2019s Third National Development Strategy (NDS-3), which aims for sustainable economic prosperity through responsible resource management (NPC. 2024).

The United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform notes that Qatar\u2019s National Vision 2030 (GCO. n.d.b) integrates social development goals to ensure justice, equality, and social cohesion, emphasizing the need for equitable workplaces (UNDESA. 2021). Promoting a sense of equity is vital for a harmonious and productive work environment. \u2022 Qatarization and National Development Goals: Qatar is actively pursuing Qatarization, aiming to develop the local workforce, as detailed by Qatar Foundation (QF)\u2019s strategic initiative to employ Qatari citizens in meaningful roles (QF. n.d.). Excessive reliance on expensive expatriate packages can hinder this strategic development of local talent and create long-term dependency on foreign labor, a concern echoed by the IMF\u2019s call for labor market reforms to boost Qatari private-sector participation (IMF. 2024b). Finding a sustainable model that attracts expatriates while fostering local talent aligns with these national goals. 1.3 Recent Developments in Qatar\u2019s Labor Laws and Worker Benefits Qatar\u2019s labor laws have been significantly enhanced, particularly since 2023, to improve worker welfare and align with international standards (MoL. n.d.; GCO. n.d.a).

While regulations aim for a balanced work environment, the practice of extending additional benefits, such as housing allowances and enhanced health insurance, primarily to certain expatriate groups, particularly Westerners, continues to exacerbate these disparities (Statista Research Department. 2022; TalentUp Team. 2024). The minimum wage implementation, introduced in 2020 at QAR 1,000 per month and linked to an inflation index since 2024 (GCO. n.d.a), aims to protect low-income workers from economic fluctuations, with stricter enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance (Team QT. 2024a). The ILO has praised this adjustment as aligning with global labor standards (ILO. 2022). The Qatari government has implemented significant labor reforms to enhance worker rights and promote equity, including abolishing the requirement for employer permission when changing jobs and establishing a non-discriminatory minimum wage (GCO. n.d.a; Hukoomi. n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d74ed1305095", "text": "hance worker rights and promote equity, including abolishing the requirement for employer permission when changing jobs and establishing a non-discriminatory minimum wage (GCO. n.d.a; Hukoomi. n.d.). However, while these reforms represent substantial progress, there is no current evidence of tax incentives specifically for companies adopting equitable practices, and the minimum wage does not fully resolve the wider compensation gaps, especially at higher salary levels (TimeCamp. n.d.; Team QT. 2024a). Addressing these ongoing disparities remains a challenge for Qatar in its pursuit of equitable treatment and workplace harmony.

Package Components In Qatar, housing allowances are a crucial component of employee compensation, with substantial diherences between expatriates and nationals. Understanding these distinctions is vital for employers and employees navigating the housing and employment landscape. Housing policies reflect economic trends, labor market strategies, and the country\u2019s long-term development vision, making them a key area for analysis and policy planning. 2.1 Housing Allowances 2.1.1 Housing Support for Expatriate Employees Expatriate employees in Qatar often receive substantial housing allowances or fully covered accommodations as part of their compensation packages (Expat Arrivals. n.d.a.; Stah Source International. n.d.).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 12, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_488db940cb9c", "text": "riate employees in Qatar often receive substantial housing allowances or fully covered accommodations as part of their compensation packages (Expat Arrivals. n.d.a.; Stah Source International. n.d.). This practice aims to attract and retain international talent by ohsetting the high cost of living in desirable areas like The Pearl and West Bay (SAAKIN. n.d.a.; ARAB MLS. n.d.a.). \u2022 Cost Implications: High-end housing in premium locations significantly increases corporate expenditures, especially for organizations employing numerous expatriates. Rental costs in Qatar are among the highest in the Gulf region, making housing allowances a major portion of an employer\u2019s compensation budget (ARAB MLS. n.d.b.; FGREALTY Qatar. 2025). Furthermore, expatriates often prefer rental properties with premium amenities, further inflating the cost of employer-sponsored housing (Expat Arrivals. n.d.b.). \u2022 Nationality Considerations: The extent of housing benefits varies, with employees from higher-income countries receiving larger allowances to match their accustomed living standards. Conversely, expatriates from lower-income regions or those hired locally may receive modest or no housing stipends (Stah Source International. n.d.).

The government provides extensive healthcare services for Qatari nationals, whereas expatriates rely on employer-sponsored insurance, which is now mandated under recent legislative reforms (GCO. 2022). The introduction of the National Health Strategy 2024-2030 underscores Qatar\u2019s commitment to enhancing healthcare accessibility and ehiciency for all residents, regardless of nationality (GCO. 2024; Generis Global Legal Services. 2024).

Additionally, retired Qatari nationals receive generous post-employment benefits, including pension schemes and financial allowances to support their standard of living after retirement (The Peninsula. 2022). These packages are shaped by Qatarization policies, aiming to enhance local workforce participation while ensuring competitive compensation (MoL. 2024c; QF. n.d.; IMF. 2024a). In addition to state-funded benefits, Qatari nationals benefit from financial allowances such as marriage grants and land allocation for home construction, further incentivizing workforce participation (Remoly. n.d.; Multiplier. n.d.). The Qatari government\u2019s commitment to providing a strong welfare system extends to free healthcare services and long- term financial security through pension schemes (Doha News. 2014; SAAKIN. n.d.b.). Employers have fewer direct financial obligations for housing and healthcare compared to expatriate hires, as many benefits are state-funded. However, challenges remain in attracting and retaining high- skilled Qatari professionals, particularly in specialized industries where expatriate salaries may appear more lucrative (SHRM. 2024; Maheeka. 2024; The Peninsula. 2022).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_498338a93a78", "text": "tracting and retaining high- skilled Qatari professionals, particularly in specialized industries where expatriate salaries may appear more lucrative (SHRM. 2024; Maheeka. 2024; The Peninsula. 2022). 3.1.2 Expatriate Packages These often include extensive employer-provided benefits such as housing allowances, child education support, and premium health insurance. While attractive to international talent, these packages can significantly inflate labor costs, leading some organizations to reassess the size of their expatriate workforce. The cost of expatriate benefits varies by industry, with higher compensation packages found in the oil and gas, finance, and healthcare sectors (Multiplier. n.d.; SAAKIN. n.d.b.; Qatar Steel. n.d.). Additionally, housing allowances for expatriates are among the highest in the region due to rising rental costs in major Qatari cities, further contributing to cost burdens on employers (Doha News. 2014; SAAKIN. n.d.b.; ARAB MLS. n.d.b.). Expatriates in sectors such as healthcare and education often receive transport allowances and additional financial incentives to mitigate high living costs (Dynamic Health Stah. 2024; Blyth Academy. 2024).

Over time, excessive labor costs tied to expatriate packages can reduce profitability and competitiveness, particularly in industries with narrow profit margins (Parker. 2022; Qatar Tribune. 2025; TimeCamp. n.d.). To mitigate this, some firms employ a localization strategy, systematically transitioning expatriate roles to Qatari nationals once the necessary expertise has been cultivated (Qatar Tribune. 2024a, b). Balancing Qatarization policies with labor cost ehiciency requires strategic workforce planning, ensuring that both national and expatriate employees are compensated in a manner that supports long-term sustainability (QF. n.d.; SHRM. 2024).

Social and Equity Dimensions Disparities in salary packages influence internal workplace dynamics, ahecting morale, retention, and organizational culture. As Qatar continues its labor market reforms, concerns over equitable Page 13 of 25 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team February 22th, 2025 compensation structures remain critical, particularly in balancing expatriate and local employee benefits (ILO, 2022; SHRM, 2024). 4.1 Perceptions of Inequality Disparities in compensation between expatriates and Qatari nationals remain a key issue in Qatar\u2019s labor market. While expatriates receive allowances such as housing, education, and relocation support, Qatari nationals benefit from extensive government-funded welfare provisions, including subsidized housing and financial incentives (Multiplier. n.d.; Papaya Global. 2025; The Peninsula. 2022). However, a major source of discontent arises from wage disparities among expatriates themselves. Salaries and benefits are often determined by nationality rather than qualifications or experience, leading to systemic disadvantages for lower-income expatriates from South Asia and Africa compared to their Western counterparts (Statista Research Department. 2022; World Bank Open Data. n.d.; Ali et al. 2024; Team QT. 2024b).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f7aae8a0902b", "text": "tages for lower-income expatriates from South Asia and Africa compared to their Western counterparts (Statista Research Department. 2022; World Bank Open Data. n.d.; Ali et al. 2024; Team QT. 2024b). These inequalities contribute to dissatisfaction, lower productivity, and a sense of workplace division. Additionally, disparities in job security and retirement benefits further deepen the divide. Many expatriates lack structured pension schemes, relying instead on one-time severance payments, which provide little long-term financial security (iPMI Global. 2024; Tilo. 2024). As Qatar continues its labor market reforms, closing these gaps is essential to fostering a more cohesive and equitable workforce (ILO, 2022; SHRM. 2024). 4.2 Workforce Strategies in Qatar Visible compensation gaps can generate resentment, ahecting employee morale and increasing turnover rates. Expatriates from diherent national backgrounds receive vastly diherent salary packages even when performing similar roles, with Western expatriates often commanding significantly higher wages and perks (OFW Jobs Expert. 2025; SAAKIN. n.d.b.; Habeck. 2023). This disparity leads to high attrition among undercompensated workers, particularly in industries such as oil and gas, construction, and hospitality. Furthermore, the rising cost of living in Qatar adds financial pressure, pushing companies to revise compensation structures and increase allowances to retain talent (Bhaumik. 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_37efb9cb950d", "text": "and hospitality. Furthermore, the rising cost of living in Qatar adds financial pressure, pushing companies to revise compensation structures and increase allowances to retain talent (Bhaumik. 2025). Meanwhile, Qatarization policies emphasize hiring and promoting nationals, but their implementation must be carefully managed to avoid unintended consequences such as skill gaps or reluctance among expatriates to engage in knowledge transfer (Mol. 2024b; QF. n.d.). Structured financial benefits, such as enhanced retirement plans and career progression opportunities, are critical for improving employee satisfaction and workforce stability (iPMI Global. 2024; SHRM. 2024). Without these measures, companies may struggle to maintain a committed workforce, leading to higher operational costs due to frequent hiring and retraining. 5. Conclusion Qatar\u2019s labor market continues to reflect structural imbalances shaped by segmented labor migration policies, demographic constraints, and economic priorities. On one side, the country faces a persistent shortage of skilled labor\u2014particularly in fields such as engineering, information technology, and advanced services\u2014driving competition for expatriate expertise. On the other, an oversupply of unskilled and semi-skilled workers, historically employed in Page 14 of 25 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team February 22th, 2025 construction and manual services, has placed downward pressure on wages and limited automation incentives.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 34, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f1bd119cf4b5", "text": "oyed in Page 14 of 25 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team February 22th, 2025 construction and manual services, has placed downward pressure on wages and limited automation incentives.

The prevalence of low-wage labor in key sectors may impede the transition to a high-productivity, knowledge- based economy\u2014a central objective of Qatar National Vision 2030 and the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Ehorts to address these issues have already taken shape. Qatar\u2019s labor reforms between 2018 and 2024\u2014including the abolition of NOC requirements, minimum wage implementation, and new visa categories for skilled professionals\u2014have improved worker protections and created a more competitive environment for high-skilled labor. In parallel, national workforce strategies such as Qatarization and education system reforms aim to grow the domestic talent pool and reduce dependency on foreign expertise over time. Nevertheless, these ehorts must be sustained and sharpened. To address the skilled labor gap, Qatar must continue investing in specialized education, vocational training, and high-skill immigration pipelines.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-22", "series_number": 5, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 35, "total_chunks": 60, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q5_EN_2025-02-22-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-22", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c2febe2075f4", "text": "ess, these ehorts must be sustained and sharpened. To address the skilled labor gap, Qatar must continue investing in specialized education, vocational training, and high-skill immigration pipelines. At the same time, managing the surplus of unskilled labor will require tighter control over recruitment, improved enforcement of labor rights, and support for transitioning toward higher-productivity labor models. Ensuring labor market resilience in the coming decade depends on the government\u2019s ability to coordinate these parallel tracks within a coherent workforce development strategy. Moving forward, policymakers should adopt a forward-looking, data-driven approach to workforce planning\u2014one that not only corrects labor mismatches, but also aligns with Qatar\u2019s economic diversification goals, demographic priorities, and technological ambitions. A recalibrated labor market, characterized by a balanced mix of national and expatriate talent, will be essential in delivering sustainable growth and long-term economic competitiveness.

Investment in National Talent Pipelines: Qatar should intensify its focus on technical and vocational education, including private sector co-sponsored programs, to ensure that Qatari youth are equipped with industry-relevant skills and encouraged to participate in private employment. 3. Selective Immigration and Retention Mechanisms: Long-term residency options, permanent residency programs, and family-friendly visa structures should be further developed to attract and retain highly qualified expatriates and foster long-term knowledge transfer. 4.

Policy Integration and ESG Alignment: Labor market policies must align with broader national frameworks, including Qatarization targets, social cohesion initiatives, and ESG standards. Responsible labor practices will enhance both international reputation and economic ehiciency. As Qatar continues its transition toward a diversified, high-income economy, achieving a more sustainable and balanced labor force is not only a demographic or regulatory challenge\u2014it is a strategic economic imperative. A labor market that rewards skills, fosters inclusion, and protects the dignity of all workers\u2014citizens and expatriates alike\u2014will be a cornerstone of Qatar\u2019s long- term development success. 6.

Introduction 1.1 The Imperative of Qatarization in Specialized Roles Qatarization is a strategic pillar of the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) aimed at increasing Qatari participation in the workforce, particularly in high-skilled sectors such as engineering, advanced technology, and financial services. This initiative is not merely about meeting employment quotas but about creating a self-reliant, innovation-driven workforce that can support Qatar\u2019s transition to a knowledge-based economy (GCO 2025; Middle East Briefing 2024; IMO. 2024).

With expatriates comprising approximately 94% of the labor force as of 2023 (NPC 2024), the newly enacted Qatarization Law No. 12 of 2024 has introduced stricter requirements for private enterprises to prioritize national employment in key sectors (MOL 2024a). This law mandates that companies in strategic industries, including construction, energy, and financial services, must Page 2 of 36 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team February 28th, 2025 achieve specific Qatarization targets or face penalties. Additionally, the law provides incentives such as tax exemptions and financial support for firms actively training and hiring nationals (FRAGOMEN 2024; MCIT 2025a).

Despite educational advancements, many recent graduates still show a strong preference for government jobs, often citing perceived stability, shorter working hours, and social prestige (Ceric et al. 2013; SAKURAI and SIM 2024). While the exact percentage of nationals opting for government roles may vary across digerent studies, broader qualitative findings suggest that social factors, such as family expectations and views on job prestige, play a substantial role in shaping these career decisions (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). These perceptions persist even as Qatar implements new legislation, such as Law No. (12) of 2024, which aims to create stronger incentives for Qataris to join the private sector through expanded training, financial support, and standardized employment contracts (EY 2024; MOL 2024a). Several interrelated factors continue to reinforce the government-sector appeal: \u2022 Public-Sector Appeal - Higher Salaries and Benefits: Government roles often oger salaries that surpass comparable private-sector positions, along with pension guarantees.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-28", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 86, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_74e32add2f24", "text": "government-sector appeal: \u2022 Public-Sector Appeal - Higher Salaries and Benefits: Government roles often oger salaries that surpass comparable private-sector positions, along with pension guarantees.

(The Peninsula 2024d; Microsoft News Center 2023). \u2022 Retention Challenges: Despite growing STEM enrollment, many graduates still opt for public-sector roles over technical fields (Younis, Elsharnouby, and Elbanna 2023). While precise figures vary, local observers attribute this to perceived job stability in government, higher public-sector salaries, and cultural norms favoring administrative or managerial careers over technical or R&D positions. Factors include perceived job stability in government, higher public-sector salaries, and cultural norms favoring administrative or managerial careers over technical or R&D positions. \u2022 Curriculum Gaps: STEM programs can lag rapid technological change, especially AI, robotics, and renewable energy.

For instance, Qatar\u2019s clean energy strategy has set targets for solar projects such as Al Kharsaah, underscoring the long-term benefits of local engineering expertise (Marubeni n.d.; BSTQ 2024d). By highlighting tangible contributions to QNV 2030, these outreach egorts bolster community acceptance of STEM careers outside the public sector.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-28", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 86, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_91728fa5e4d0", "text": "al engineering expertise (Marubeni n.d.; BSTQ 2024d). By highlighting tangible contributions to QNV 2030, these outreach egorts bolster community acceptance of STEM careers outside the public sector. \u2022 Industry-Academia Partnerships: Joint programs with companies like Siemens oger internships and mentorship opportunities for students - often with salary top-ups to match public-sector benefits (KAHRAMAA 2020; Qatar Tribune 2023a). In the telecom sector, local providers increasingly collaborate with universities to modernize curricula and sponsor specialized training, helping bridge the gap between academic learning and industry needs. This approach directly addresses concerns about wage digerentials and career development, making private technical roles more attractive. \u2022 Systemic Reforms: Sustaining this cultural shift requires structural changes, such as revising promotion criteria in private firms to reward innovative work, expanding vocational training, and aligning skill-development pipelines with industry demand. Initiatives like Ashghal\u2019s announced increase in Qatarization rates and the Ministry of Labour\u2019s Erada Programme highlight new pathways for nationals to build specialized skills in engineering, IT, and AI (Ashghal 2022; MOL 2025a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-28", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 86, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_acb7079b1eb7", "text": "nced increase in Qatarization rates and the Ministry of Labour\u2019s Erada Programme highlight new pathways for nationals to build specialized skills in engineering, IT, and AI (Ashghal 2022; MOL 2025a). Likewise, continued investment in vocational and continuing education - in line with the government\u2019s vision of a knowledge-based economy - helps reinforce the perception that private-sector STEM roles can be as stable and prestigious as public employment (Oxford Business Group 2019). Altogether, these strategies aim to reshape how Qatari families and students view private-sector technical roles, positioning them as viable, prestigious career paths critical for Qatar\u2019s economic diversification and sustainable development. 2. Strategies for Advancement: Building Expertise Through Education and Experience To equip nationals for high-skilled roles, Qatar has implemented a trio of interconnected strategies: international scholarships, local upskilling programs, and direct mentorship by expatriate experts. Each approach ogers unique strengths, but their egectiveness depends on addressing specific obstacles. These strategies collectively aim to create a pipeline of talent capable of meeting Qatar\u2019s ambitious development goals. 2.1 International Scholarships: Tapping Global Knowledge Scholarships to study abroad expose nationals to cutting-edge developments in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), fostering expertise that can be repatriated to Qatar.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-28", "series_number": 6, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 86, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q6_EN_2025-02-28-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-28", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a9fedc1d98e1", "text": "Knowledge Scholarships to study abroad expose nationals to cutting-edge developments in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), fostering expertise that can be repatriated to Qatar.

Introduction Cultural alignment, the congruence between organizational practices and employees\u2019 linguistic and religious backgrounds, is critical for eQective teamwork in Qatar\u2019s multicultural workforce. With over 80 nationalities contributing to the private and public sectors, organizations face both opportunities and challenges in managing diversity (Statista Research Department. 2022; The Peninsula. 2021). When managed well, cultural alignment enhances collaboration, innovation, and employee satisfaction. Conversely, misalignment can lead to miscommunication, conflict, and lost productivity (Hofstede. 2001; Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner. 1997). 2.

Companies that provide on-site prayer rooms and flexible break schedules for the five daily prayers see a 10% reduction in unscheduled absences and a 12% increase in overall morale (U.S. Department of State. 2023; Whiteford et al. 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-30", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 31, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_6a6e7b2ef97f", "text": "rooms and flexible break schedules for the five daily prayers see a 10% reduction in unscheduled absences and a 12% increase in overall morale (U.S. Department of State. 2023; Whiteford et al. 2025).

In Qatar\u2019s multicultural workplaces, cultural alignment, particularly through clear language policies and sensitivity to high-context norms, directly influences how eQiciently information is shared, understood, and acted upon. 3.1.1 Theoretical Foundations \u2022 High- vs. Low-Context Cultures Edward Hall\u2019s framework distinguishes \u201chigh-context\u201d cultures (where much is communicated implicitly through nonverbal cues, shared history, and situational context) from \u201clow-context\u201d cultures (where messages are made explicit in words) (Hall. 1976). \u2022 Anxiety/Uncertainty Management Gudykunst\u2019s model posits that reducing anxiety and uncertainty in intercultural interactions, through language certainty and cultural training, lowers communication breakdowns (Gudykunst. 1998). 3.1.2 Language Policies and Training \u2022 Corporate-Wide English Proficiency Targets Mandating minimum English levels for project leads and client-facing roles ensures critical information isn\u2019t lost in translation. Organizations adopting such targets have seen: o 20% reduction in misinterpretation incidents o 15% faster decision-making cycles o 10% increase in reported clarity on deliverables (TimeCamp.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-30", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 31, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5bd4a81f48d7", "text": "lation. Organizations adopting such targets have seen: o 20% reduction in misinterpretation incidents o 15% faster decision-making cycles o 10% increase in reported clarity on deliverables (TimeCamp. n.d.; Statista Research Department. 2022). \u2022 Bilingual Documentation Technical manuals and safety protocols produced in both English and Arabic help bridge gaps for local and expatriate staQ alike. In construction and energy sectors, dual- language guides have cut on-site errors by 18% (ResearchGate. 2024; Khan. 2025). 3.1.3 Nonverbal Communication and High-Context Awareness \u2022 Gesture and Proxemics Arab and South Asian cultures often use expressive hand gestures and maintain diQerent interpersonal distances than Western norms. Training that highlights these diQerences reduces unintended signals, for example, a thumbs-up sign may be perceived diQerently across communities (Camacho. 2025). \u2022 Paraverbal Cues Tone, pacing, and silence carry meaning in high-context settings. Workshops that Page 4 of 18 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 30th, 2025 include role-plays and video analysis of real workplace scenarios have been shown to decrease nonverbal misunderstandings by 25% (Camacho. 2025; Khan. 2025). 3.1.4 Technology-Enabled Alignment \u2022 Real-Time Translation Tools Integrations of AI-powered translation in messaging platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) allow instant bridging of language gaps.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-30", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 8, "total_chunks": 31, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c2a8686fb6b8", "text": "3.1.4 Technology-Enabled Alignment \u2022 Real-Time Translation Tools Integrations of AI-powered translation in messaging platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) allow instant bridging of language gaps.

By combining these strategies, organizations in Qatar can achieve markedly higher levels of communication eQiciency, laying the groundwork for cohesive, productive teams. 3.2 Conflict Resolution Cultural misalignments often arise in how employees perceive authority, express disagreement, and negotiate solutions. In Qatar\u2019s diverse teams, understanding these diQerences, and putting in place structured, culturally sensitive mechanisms, can dramatically shorten dispute durations, preserve relationships, and sustain productivity. 3.2.1 Theoretical Foundations \u2022 Hofstede\u2019s Dimensions Page 5 of 18 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 30th, 2025 o Power Distance: Qatar scores moderate (41/100), indicating acceptance of hierarchy but with growing expectations for participative management. Many South Asian and African expatriate groups exhibit higher Power Distance, expecting clear directives from superiors (Hofstede. 2001; Al Mannai. 2025). o Individualism vs. Collectivism: Qatar\u2019s relatively high Individualism (78/100) contrasts with the collectivist orientations of many expatriates (e.g., Filipinos, Indians), who emphasize group harmony over personal assertiveness (Hofstede. 2001). \u2022 Trompenaars\u2019 Dimensions o Specific vs. Dieuse: Expatriates from low-diQuse cultures (e.g., Western Europeans) compartmentalize work and personal life, preferring direct feedback.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-30", "series_number": 7, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 31, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q7_EN_2025-05-30.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-30", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5328cf41d326", "text": "(Hofstede. 2001). \u2022 Trompenaars\u2019 Dimensions o Specific vs. Dieuse: Expatriates from low-diQuse cultures (e.g., Western Europeans) compartmentalize work and personal life, preferring direct feedback. In contrast, diQuse-oriented cultures (e.g., Arabs, South Asians) view relationships holistically and may interpret blunt criticism as personal attack (Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner. 1997). \u2022 Thomas\u2013Kilmann Conflict Modes o Five styles, Competing, Collaborating, Compromising, Avoiding, and Accommodating, manifest diQerently across cultures. For instance, high- avoidance groups may defer rather than confront, prolonging low-grade tensions (Thomas & Kilmann. 1974). 3.2.2 Cultural Dimensions Impacting Conflict Styles Dimension Qatari/National Common Typical Conflict Style Norm Expatriate Norms Power Distance Moderate; respect High in South Qatari: Consultative; S.

In Qatar\u2019s knowledge-driven economy, spanning energy, finance, and ICT, multicultural teams convert varied perspectives into novel solutions, driving competitive advantage. 3.3.1 Theoretical Foundations \u2022 Componential Theory of Creativity Amabile (1983) posits that creativity arises from the intersection of domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes (e.g., divergent thinking), and intrinsic motivation. In diverse teams, domain expertise is broadened by diQerent cultural lenses, while intrinsic motivation flourishes when members feel valued for their unique contributions. \u2022 Social Identity and Information Processing According to Social Identity Theory, individuals categorize themselves by group membership (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Multicultural environments expand the \u201cinformation space,\u201d introducing varied schemas that spur atypical connections, a phenomenon known as \u201cknowledge recombination\u201d (Weber & Cameron, 2005). 3.3.2 Mechanisms of Innovation in Diverse Teams 1.

As of 2023, non-Qataris accounted for approximately 91% of the labor force \u2013 a figure that has remained largely stable since 2018, following a high of 92.5% in 2016 (PSA 2019, NPC 2024a). This modest decline reflects early policy e_orts to nationalize segments of the workforce, although the structure of labor demand remains highly dependent on foreign workers. Labor force participation data further confirms these patterns, with non-Qataris maintaining a participation rate of 91.1% in 2023, compared to 54.4% for Qataris. Notably, Qatari female participation has gradually risen \u2013 from 37.1% in 2018 to 43.5% in 2023 \u2013 indicating a slow but steady response to policy measures introduced under the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) (NPC 2024a). Despite this change, expatriate labor continues to dominate the workforce and remains essential to sustaining economic activity across key sectors. However, this structure has produced a segmented labor market. According to 2023 labor force distribution data, Qatari nationals \u2013 particularly women \u2013 are predominantly employed in education and health (33.5%) and public administration (37.8%). Qatari males are similarly concentrated in public administration (63.1%) and education and health (8.5%) (NPC 2024d).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_b254e5216b1b", "text": "antly employed in education and health (33.5%) and public administration (37.8%).

These trends suggest that national labor is more present in public sector and service-oriented roles. In contrast, non-Qatari males are heavily concentrated in construction (38.3%), trade (13.1%), and administrative services (9.5%), while 30.6% of non-Qatari females work in household activities (NPC 2024d). Although these figures do not directly indicate skill levels, they reflect a structural reliance on foreign labor in labor-intensive and domestic service sectors. These Page 2 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 12th, 2025 conditions contribute to wage polarization, uneven productivity growth, and reinforce the urgency of continued labor market reform. 1.2 Skilled Labor vs. Unskilled Labor Composition The occupational structure of Qatar\u2019s foreign workforce is heavily weighted toward unskilled and semi-skilled roles. According to the Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA), over 62% of the economically active non-Qatari population aged 15 years and above in 2020 were classified as unskilled (20.2%) or semi-skilled (42.2%). In contrast, only 14.9% were categorized as skilled and 22.8% as highly skilled (PPC 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d936dc0eed50", "text": "ri population aged 15 years and above in 2020 were classified as unskilled (20.2%) or semi-skilled (42.2%). In contrast, only 14.9% were categorized as skilled and 22.8% as highly skilled (PPC 2023). This distribution highlights the enduring imbalance between the labor demanded in Qatar\u2019s evolving economy and the actual occupational makeup of its expatriate labor force. The skewed distribution reflects historical recruitment priorities aligned with labor-intensive development phases, particularly in construction, hospitality, and personal services. While this model enabled cost-e_icient project execution, it created long-term vulnerabilities. A limited pool of skilled professionals, whether local or foreign, restricts the country\u2019s ability to advance toward a knowledge-based economy. In parallel, the oversupply of low-skilled workers has dampened labor productivity growth and placed downward pressure on wages, particularly in sectors with thin profit margins or minimal technological uptake.

On the skilled side, gaps remain in key fields such as engineering, ICT, and health due to limited domestic graduate output, global talent competition, and the underutilization of existing STEM education capacity (UNESCO 2024; Alkhayareen 2023). While STEM and TVET initiatives \u2013 supported by entities such as UNESCO \u2013 aim to bridge this gap, their e_ectiveness is constrained by factors like the preference for public sector careers and limited practical training pathways (Alkhayareen 2023). Page 3 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 12th, 2025 Meanwhile, the continued oversupply of unskilled labor stems from long-standing recruitment patterns, low labor costs, and ongoing demand in sectors such as construction and domestic services. Many workers from South and Southeast Asia remain in low-wage roles due to the lack of skill recognition and limited career mobility, even when their qualifications exceed the roles they perform (Mohamed 2021; Sayre, Benmansour, and Constant 2015). Together, these dynamics reduce the incentive for firms to modernize or upskill their workforce, reinforcing wage disparities and limiting long-term labor market adaptability.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_fff547b96ee5", "text": "ur, and Constant 2015).

This dynamic a_ects productivity, wage dynamics, and the pace of innovation across sectors. Addressing this imbalance is central to the national development agenda. The Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) and Qatar\u2019s 2021 Voluntary National Review both emphasize the need to improve workforce e_iciency, diversify employment pathways, and reduce dependency on low-wage labor in order to support a knowledge-based economy (PSA 2021; NPC 2024b). Unresolved skill shortages risk constraining the competitiveness of key growth sectors such as advanced manufacturing, digital services, and healthcare, while oversupply of unskilled labor may perpetuate low productivity in construction and personal services sectors (IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2024; Kabbani 2025a).

It retains the structure of the original analysis while expanding each section with up-to- date insights. Section 2 delves into the drivers and evidence of skilled labor shortages in Qatar. Section 3 explores the causes and consequences of unskilled labor surpluses. In Section 4, we assess the economic and social impacts of these imbalances and review the policy measures implemented in response \u2013 including recent labor market reforms and initiatives under national strategies. Section 5 discusses future outlook and recommendations, considering how ongoing e_orts (such as Qatar\u2019s Third National Development Strategy 2023\u20132030) aim to rebalance the labor market.

Drivers of Skilled Labor Shortages 2.1 Sector-Specific Skilled Labor Demand Pressures Qatar\u2019s recent economic transformation has sharply increased demand for skilled professionals across key sectors. NDS-3 identifies ICT, healthcare, education, and advanced manufacturing as critical growth areas, all of which face persistent labor shortages. The expansion of these sectors has outpaced the availability of qualified local talent, posing a serious risk to long-term growth. The following subsections examine each sector\u2019s labor challenges in detail. 2.1.1 ICT and Digital Economy Needs Demand for ICT professionals in Qatar is surging as the country advances its digitally driven transformation.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c82c53c2969e", "text": "ons examine each sector\u2019s labor challenges in detail. 2.1.1 ICT and Digital Economy Needs Demand for ICT professionals in Qatar is surging as the country advances its digitally driven transformation. With ICT contributing 2.7% of GDP in 2022 and the market projected to grow from $5.8 billion in 2024 to $6.3 billion by 2027, the increase in demand is driven by major national initiatives under the Digital Agenda 2030 (MCIT 2024a), as well as the rapid expansion of 5G, cloud computing, AI, and smart government infrastructure (Telecom Review 2022; Embassy of Switzerland in Qatar 2024). According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the ICT sector is already a key contributor to Qatar\u2019s economy (ITA 2024a). These developments have created mounting pressure on the local labor market to supply the technical expertise required to sustain this momentum. However, several structural barriers limit the local labor supply: \u2022 Skilled talent shortage: Reliance on expatriates remains high, particularly for software, data science, and cybersecurity roles \u2022 Narrow domestic talent pipeline: Few graduates emerge annually from ICT-related university programs \u2022 Strong global competition: Skilled ICT workers are in high demand worldwide, making recruitment and retention challenging These shortages have left key digital roles unfilled and driven up wages, particularly in cybersecurity, data science, and cloud engineering.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_a8ee11c7f724", "text": "d worldwide, making recruitment and retention challenging These shortages have left key digital roles unfilled and driven up wages, particularly in cybersecurity, data science, and cloud engineering. The limited domestic talent pool remains a bottleneck, even as global firms operate in Qatar. To mitigate this, Qatar has introduced talent development programs and long-term visa schemes designed to attract skilled foreign tech professionals (MCIT 2024b). In parallel, initiatives such as the Qatar Digital Academy are investing in building national digital talent (MCIT, 2024a). These measures are a step forward, but sustained investment in local STEM education and practical training remains essential. Without it, Qatar\u2019s digital transformation goals under NDS-3 risk being slowed by persistent human capital gaps (Embassy of Switzerland in Qatar 2024). 2.1.2 Healthcare and Medical Sector Gaps Qatar\u2019s healthcare sector has grown swiftly in response to population pressures and sustained public investment.

These causes are systemic in nature and cut across sectors, limiting the supply of qualified labor even as economic diversification accelerates. We identify four interrelated drivers: demographic constraints, education-to-employment gaps, institutional policies, and labor market incentives.

Within the Qatari population, male participation stood at 66.0% and female participation at 43.5% (NPC 2024a). Qatari women\u2019s participation peaks between ages 35\u201339 at 78.1%; however, the steady decline in labor force participation among younger women aged 20\u201324 \u2013 from 37.1% in 2018 to just 19.4% in 2023 \u2013 signals emerging structural barriers at the entry point to employment (NPC 2024a).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 18, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e24e65e4f00b", "text": "ady decline in labor force participation among younger women aged 20\u201324 \u2013 from 37.1% in 2018 to just 19.4% in 2023 \u2013 signals emerging structural barriers at the entry point to employment (NPC 2024a). These may include misalignment between educational pathways and labor market readiness, limited early-career opportunities in preferred sectors, or shifting social expectations, all of which merit closer policy attention. This downward trend raises concerns about the future availability of skilled national labor, particularly since this age group represents a crucial transition phase from education to employment.

Career guidance services are also fragmented, inconsistently delivered across schools, and lack alignment with current labor market trends (QATAR CAREER FAIR 2015). These deficiencies are particularly pronounced among female students, who often face social expectations that steer them away from technical and vocational careers (Wazen 2025). Programs such as UNESCO\u2019s support for STEM and TVET reform and the expansion of UDST represent important advances.

This section analyzes the structural roots of this imbalance, which is the inverse of the shortages seen in high-skilled occupations. It highlights three interconnected drivers: migrant labor recruitment patterns, sectoral employment segmentation, and limited upskilling pathways. 2.3.1 Migrant Labor Recruitment and Sponsorship Model Qatar\u2019s historical labor market model has depended on the large-scale recruitment of low-wage foreign workers, especially in construction, hospitality, and domestic service sectors. According to 2023 labor force data, 2,055,643 non-Qatari workers were economically active, with particularly high concentrations in construction (668,908), wholesale and retail trade (252,608), and administrative and support service activities (195,852) (NPC 2024a). These labor-intensive sectors \u2013 particularly construction, retail, cleaning, and security \u2013 account for a substantial share of expatriate employment and reflect Qatar\u2019s continued reliance on low-cost manual labor.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_163b5cdc893f", "text": "tensive sectors \u2013 particularly construction, retail, cleaning, and security \u2013 account for a substantial share of expatriate employment and reflect Qatar\u2019s continued reliance on low-cost manual labor.

These structural constraints have made upward mobility di_icult, reinforcing a cycle of low productivity and skill stagnation. The sponsorship system\u2019s legacy continues to shape labor migration flows, which remain concentrated in low-wage, low-mobility occupations misaligned with Qatar\u2019s evolving labor market strategy and long-term diversification goals. 2.3.2 Sectoral Concentration and Labor Cost Incentives Qatar\u2019s economic structure continues to drive demand for low-skilled labor in sectors such as construction, hospitality, domestic work, and logistics. These sectors often operate under contracts that emphasize workforce volume and speed of delivery over skill intensity, reinforcing the attractiveness of inexpensive manual labor. Firms are incentivized to maintain large low-skill workforces due to: \u2022 Cost structures that favor headcount over productivity \u2022 Weak enforcement of e_iciency standards \u2022 Limited urgency to adopt labor-saving technologies This dual labor market has persisted due to both market conditions and institutional inertia.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0fe97df34653", "text": "oductivity \u2022 Weak enforcement of e_iciency standards \u2022 Limited urgency to adopt labor-saving technologies This dual labor market has persisted due to both market conditions and institutional inertia. Studies by the BTI and IMF observe that firms often lack meaningful pressure to restructure toward higher-productivity models (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2024; IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2025a). Wage compression at the lower end discourages investment in training, and recruitment patterns shaped by events such as the 2017\u20132021 blockade have continued to favor short-term sourcing over long-term development (Javed 2018). As Iskander and Keshavarzian (2022) argue, the persistence of segmentation stems more from political and institutional resistance to change than from pure market logic. These dynamic limits the overall productivity and e_iciency of Qatar\u2019s economy. 2.3.3 Limited Mobility and Upskilling Mechanisms Although recent reforms have sought to enhance worker mobility and skills recognition, many low-wage workers remain unable to advance due to structural barriers such as: \u2022 Language proficiency gaps and lack of recognized qualifications \u2022 Employer resistance to internal promotion \u2022 Unequal access to vocational retraining and digital resources Platforms like Kawader and Ministry of Labor\u2013Microsoft training partnerships have expanded access to job-matching and reskilling opportunities.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 28, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e5221a5671da", "text": "l access to vocational retraining and digital resources Platforms like Kawader and Ministry of Labor\u2013Microsoft training partnerships have expanded access to job-matching and reskilling opportunities.

This section analyzes how these imbalances manifest across key dimensions of economic performance and outlines the macroeconomic risks if left unaddressed. 2.4.1 Reduced Labor Productivity and Output per Worker The overrepresentation of low-productivity employment in labor-intensive sectors\u2014such as construction, cleaning, and retail\u2014continues to constrain output per worker in Qatar\u2019s non- energy economy. While GDP per capita remains high (QAR 253,000 in 2023) due to capital- intensive sectors like hydrocarbons (QAR 304.5 billion), productivity in non-energy segments remains below potential. Labor-heavy sectors such as construction (QAR 89.0 billion), wholesale and retail trade (QAR 56.2 billion), and accommodation and food service activities (QAR 6.9 billion) absorb large workforces but contribute disproportionately less to national output (NPC 2024c).

While targeted skilling partnerships are emerging, the talent gap remains a binding constraint on private-sector scaling. Meanwhile, surpluses of low-skilled labor inflate HR, accommodation, and onboarding costs without proportional productivity returns, particularly in labor-intensive industries. ESCWA (2025) highlights that limited alignment between education output and employer needs in Qatar further exacerbates these imbalances, especially in high-skill sectors. This mismatch between workforce composition and sectoral demand undermines the business environment, weakens return on capital investment, and limits the competitiveness of Qatari firms in value-added and export-oriented segments. Unless addressed through a coordinated skills agenda, these structural bottlenecks may continue to inhibit private-sector contribution to economic diversification.

According to BNP Paribas (2020), this model \u2013 though cost-e_ective in the short term \u2013 has long- term budgetary consequences, particularly when economic shocks reduce fiscal flexibility. At the same time, the underemployment of educated nationals \u2013 particularly women and youth \u2013 represents a critical missed opportunity to capitalize on domestic human capital. Studies show that structural preferences in the labor market, combined with employer biases and rigid labor segmentation, continue to limit inclusive participation (Khan 2022). If these imbalances persist, they may constrain long-term fiscal space, widen inequality, and erode institutional capacity to deliver socially cohesive and inclusive development outcomes. 2.4.4 Distorted Incentives in Labor Allocation Qatar\u2019s labor market remains shaped by legacy structures that prioritize low-wage labor cost e_iciency over productivity-oriented employment models. Despite a wave of reforms, labor allocation remains driven more by visa-linked employment schemes and administrative quotas than by long-term human capital planning or productivity alignment. Research indicates that wage compression and standardized remuneration packages have reduced incentives for firms to develop internal career ladders or di_erentiated talent strategies (QFC 2025).

The fragmentation of Qatarization e_orts across sectors \u2013 especially in strategic industries such as energy, ICT, and health \u2013 has limited the impact of policy on actual hiring decisions (The Peninsula 2024). As a result, highly educated nationals are often underutilized, while many skilled expatriates are placed in roles below their capacity due to rigid credentialing or visa limitations (Almeer, Bhatti, and Babar 2025). Without recalibrated labor incentives, including flexible employment schemes, skill-based migration pathways, and improved intersectoral planning, Qatar risks entrenching a low-skill equilibrium that undermines its innovation ambitions and long-term competitiveness. 3.

It highlights how project-driven labor demand, recruitment patterns, and institutional structures contributed to persistent ine_iciencies and vulnerabilities in the labor market. 3.1 Infrastructure Boom and Labor Influx As noted in Section 2, Qatar\u2019s rapid development \u2013 particularly the construction surge linked to the 2022 World Cup \u2013 generated labor demand far beyond domestic supply. The government reportedly spent over $300 billion on stadiums, transport, and urban infrastructure (Bibolov et al. 2024), drawing millions of migrant workers into roles across construction, hospitality, and services. These inflows spurred GDP and population growth, though largely concentrated in capital-intensive sectors with limited domestic spillovers (Bibolov et al. 2024). The European Page 14 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar TMO - Research Team May 12th, 2025 Parliamentary Research Service (2021) similarly warns that such mega-events often produce short-term economic gains but leave structural labor mismatches when demand fades (Immenkamp 2021). Key features of the labor market during this period included: \u2022 Extremely low Qatari participation: In 2023, only 124,665 of the 2.18 million economically active population were Qatari nationals-just 5.7% (NPC 2024a). \u2022 Heavy reliance on expatriate labor: Over 94% of the workforce consisted of non- nationals.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 37, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_95306b9a1744", "text": "ly 124,665 of the 2.18 million economically active population were Qatari nationals-just 5.7% (NPC 2024a). \u2022 Heavy reliance on expatriate labor: Over 94% of the workforce consisted of non- nationals. \u2022 Sectoral demand concentration: Most migrants were employed in labor-intensive roles across construction, services, and hospitality. \u2022 Demographic impact: Qatar\u2019s labor force grew from 280,000 in 1997 to over 2.1 million by 2017, almost entirely due to foreign workers (Kabbani 2025b). This led to a sharp rise in low-skilled migrant workers, mostly from South Asia, drawn by job opportunities linked to Qatar\u2019s infrastructure boom. While this strategy met urgent labor needs, it also created structural reliance on foreign workers \u2013 who by 2022 made up an estimated 95% of the labor force (Garver-A_eldt 2022). The same source warns that such models expose migrants to job insecurity, weak protections, and limited post-project planning, leaving many stranded once major projects conclude. 3.2 Readily Available Low-Cost Labor Qatar\u2019s labor policies historically made it easy and inexpensive to import and retain low-skilled foreign workers, contributing to persistent labor surpluses. The core driver was the kafala (sponsorship) system, which tied workers\u2019 residency to their employers.

Key factors contributing to labor oversupply: \u2022 Kafala system control: Allowed employers to restrict job mobility, withhold wages, and confiscate passports (Walk Free n.d.; ILO 2019). \u2022 Delayed wage reform: No minimum wage existed until 2021. The introduced minimum (QAR 1,000/month + allowances) benefited ~400,000 workers but remains modest (ILO 2020). \u2022 Low-cost labor advantage: Migrants from South Asia accepted low wages due to limited alternatives and remittance opportunities, reducing employer incentives to raise productivity. \u2022 Weak enforcement of reforms: Despite abolishing the exit permit and No Objection Certificate, many employers still block transfers using informal means (Campbell 2022; ILO 2020). These conditions have produced a segmented labor market. Many surplus workers remain \"locked in\" \u2013 unable to shift to sectors with demand or repatriate \u2013 while others idle between projects, exacerbating ine_iciencies and limiting mobility.

Key demographic consequences include: \u2022 Expatriate dominance: As of the 2020 census, non-Qataris made up approximately 94% of the economically active population aged 15 and above (PPC 2023). Overall, foreign nationals represent over 88-91% of Qatar's total population (Kabbani 2025a). \u2022 Extreme gender imbalance: Due to the predominance of male labor migrants, Qatar's population is now about 75% male (PPC 2023).

Associated societal and infrastructure pressures: \u2022 Infrastructure gap: Qatar's population expanded from 369,000 in 1986 to nearly 3 million in 2020 (PPC 2023), driven mostly by labor inflows. Infrastructure investment \u2013 such as Labour City with a capacity of up to 100,000 workers \u2013 lagged behind, resulting in overcrowded industrial zones. \u2022 Housing disparity: Migrant accommodations are often concentrated in designated zones, where overcrowding and low standards remain prevalent.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 40, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_337b27287e5d", "text": "agged behind, resulting in overcrowded industrial zones. \u2022 Housing disparity: Migrant accommodations are often concentrated in designated zones, where overcrowding and low standards remain prevalent. \u2022 Limited integration pathways: The temporary and segmented nature of labor migration restricts social integration, with minimal access to long-term residence or citizenship (Kabbani 2025b). An economic side-e_ect of the labor oversupply has been persistent wage stagnation in lower- skilled occupations. Anecdotal evidence and historical employer practices suggest that wages for many manual and service jobs remained flat for years, particularly prior to the 2021 minimum wage reform. Although the minimum wage improved conditions for the lowest-paid workers, it also formalized a low wage benchmark. With limited bargaining power and high worker turnover, employers had little incentive to raise wages or invest in labor productivity. Finally, the surplus of expatriate labor has led to a significant outflow of earnings as remittances.

Emerging sectors such as tourism and LNG provided new employment avenues, and by late 2024, overall employment had surpassed pre-World Cup levels (IMF 2024; IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2025a). However, not all displaced workers were well-positioned to benefit. IMF sources emphasize that while Qatar's economy continues to diversify and digitize, a significant portion of the existing workforce remains mismatched to emerging demand, especially in areas requiring digital fluency and soft skills (Kularatne, Miyajima, and Muir 2024).

Central to this transition is Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030) and the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), both of which emphasize productivity, sustainability, and workforce diversification. Key policy directions under NDS3 include: \u2022 Reducing sectoral overreliance on low-skill labor by targeting value-added industries and modern services (PSA 2024; IMF. Middle East and Central Asia Dept. 2025a). \u2022 Expanding female labor participation, especially among young Qataris, through policy support, workplace flexibility, and career development initiatives aimed at reducing inactivity rates (PPC 2023; PSA 2024). \u2022 Streamlining migration and visa policies to better align labor inflows with sectoral demand, while gradually phasing out dependence on low-productivity occupations (PSA 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf", "doc_type": "quarterly_research", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-05-12", "series_number": 8, "topic": "labor_market_research", "chunk_index": 44, "total_chunks": 85, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_Q8_EN_2025-05-12-v3.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-05-12", "doc_type": "quarterly_research"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c25e66a9f4bd", "text": "(PPC 2023; PSA 2024). \u2022 Streamlining migration and visa policies to better align labor inflows with sectoral demand, while gradually phasing out dependence on low-productivity occupations (PSA 2024).

Consequently, the role of human practitioners is shifting toward validating AI- generated insights, prioritizing patient-centered care, and ensuring ethical oversight, maintaining alignment between AI-driven medical decisions and expert judgment while fostering interpretability and trustworthiness in clinical practice (Mosqueira\u2011Rey et al. 2023). Legal Sector \u2022 Law: AI is increasingly used in legal research, case analysis, and compliance automation (ITU. 2024; Pew Research Center. 2023).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 13, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_16d327374568", "text": "iness in clinical practice (Mosqueira\u2011Rey et al. 2023). Legal Sector \u2022 Law: AI is increasingly used in legal research, case analysis, and compliance automation (ITU. 2024; Pew Research Center. 2023). These applications enhance efficiency in legal services but introduce concerns about fairness, transparency, and potential biases embedded in AI models. The use of AI in decision-support systems for legal rulings necessitates careful oversight to ensure ethical and unbiased outcomes. Legal professionals must focus on interpretation, argumentation, and verifying AI-generated recommendations to prevent unjust or opaque legal conclusions. Financial Services \u2022 Finance: AI powers algorithmic trading, risk assessment, and fraud detection (Vaccaro, Almaatouq, and Malone. 2024; Mitchell et al. 2025). While improving efficiency, AI-driven finance introduces risks such as market manipulation, systemic instability, and market volatility risks (Uuk et al. 2024). The integration of AI in financial markets also raises concerns about automated decision opacity and algorithmic bias, necessitating explainability and fairness mechanisms (Mitchell et al. 2025). Human expertise remains essential for strategic decision-making, risk mitigation, and regulatory compliance to ensure AI-driven markets remain transparent and accountable. Academic and Research \u2022 Academia: AI is increasingly used for literature reviews, hypothesis generation, and academic writing assistance (Mehrotra et al. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 14, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e97863681c36", "text": "ts remain transparent and accountable. Academic and Research \u2022 Academia: AI is increasingly used for literature reviews, hypothesis generation, and academic writing assistance (Mehrotra et al. 2024). While AI enhances research efficiency, it also raises concerns about over-reliance on AI-generated content and maintaining academic integrity (Nguyen et al. 2024). Uuk et al.

AI- driven content prioritization risks amplifying engagement-driven news over investigative reporting. Human oversight and editorial accountability remain essential to maintaining journalistic integrity. While AI tools improve reporting efficiency, they also risk reinforcing pre-existing biases in news coverage and prioritizing engagement-driven content over investigative depth. Hybrid AI-human editorial workflows should emphasize fact verification, transparency, and journalistic accountability to uphold media integrity in an AI-enhanced news ecosystem. Journalists must prioritize fact verification, in-depth analysis, and investigative reporting to maintain journalistic integrity in an AI-enhanced media landscape. Technical and Engineering Fields \u2022 Engineering: AI enhances predictive maintenance, process optimization, and design simulations, improving efficiency and reducing costs (Vaccaro, Almaatouq, and Malone. 2024; Uuk et al. 2024). Machine learning models anticipate system failures, minimizing downtime and operational risks (Mehrotra et al. 2024; Mosqueira-Rey et al. 2023). While AI-driven automation accelerates engineering workflows, the lack of transparency in AI decision-making raises concerns about reliability and accountability (Nguyen et al.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_85455ed376dc", "text": "eira-Rey et al. 2023). While AI-driven automation accelerates engineering workflows, the lack of transparency in AI decision-making raises concerns about reliability and accountability (Nguyen et al. Page 7 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 2024). Engineers must ensure AI applications align with safety regulations and ethical standards through rigorous validation and oversight. \u2022 Cybersecurity: AI improves threat detection, intrusion response, and risk assessment, yet adversarial AI techniques create new security challenges (Mitchell et al. 2025). Broader systemic risks, including automated cyber threats and AI-driven misinformation campaigns, further complicate digital security (Uuk et al. 2024). Cybersecurity professionals will need to focus on AI adversarial defense strategies, ethical hacking, and human-led security audits to maintain resilience against evolving AI-driven threats. Cybersecurity professionals will need to focus on AI adversarial defense strategies, ethical hacking, and human-led security audits to maintain resilience against evolving AI- driven threats. Administrative and Operational Roles \u2022 Healthcare Administration: AI is increasingly used to automate administrative tasks in healthcare, such as medical record management, insurance claims processing, and hospital workflow optimization (Mehrotra et al. 2024; Mosqueira-Rey et al. 2023; Costa and Moore. 2025; Putty 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 18, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_829cc3fab155", "text": "in healthcare, such as medical record management, insurance claims processing, and hospital workflow optimization (Mehrotra et al. 2024; Mosqueira-Rey et al. 2023; Costa and Moore. 2025; Putty 2025). While AI enhances efficiency, it also raises concerns regarding data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and ethical challenges in AI decision- making, particularly in automated systems that handle sensitive information (Mitchell et al. 2025; ITU. 2024). Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and implementing AI auditing mechanisms is essential to safeguarding patient rights and maintaining trust in AI-driven healthcare systems. The increasing reliance on AI in healthcare administration necessitates robust data protection policies, AI auditing mechanisms, and human oversight in critical decision-making processes to safeguard patient rights and ensure regulatory compliance. \u2022 Supply Chain & Logistics: AI is increasingly utilized for process automation, demand forecasting, and inventory management, improving operational efficiency. However, over- reliance on AI can lead to supply chain disruptions, reduced adaptability in crisis situations, and increased vulnerability to algorithmic inefficiencies. To mitigate these risks, human oversight, contingency planning, and adaptive decision-making frameworks should be integrated into AI-driven supply chain operations to maintain resilience and responsiveness.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d7f31adf96b2", "text": "gate these risks, human oversight, contingency planning, and adaptive decision-making frameworks should be integrated into AI-driven supply chain operations to maintain resilience and responsiveness.

To mitigate these risks, human oversight, contingency planning, and adaptive decision-making frameworks should be integrated into AI-driven supply chain operations to maintain resilience and responsiveness. \u2022 Customer Service & Retail: AI-powered chatbots, recommendation engines, and dynamic pricing models are reshaping customer interactions (Felin and Holweg. 2024). While improving efficiency, AI-driven retail may result in depersonalized customer experiences and workforce displacement. Businesses should balance AI automation with human-led customer engagement strategies to preserve personalized service quality. 3.2.4 Future Implications and Adaptations As AI continues evolving, professionals across industries must adapt by developing AI literacy, critical evaluation skills, and hybrid collaboration strategies. The key to mitigating AI-related Page 8 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 risks lies in proactive policy development, human-AI integration frameworks, and ongoing ethical oversight.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c7762ed117be", "text": "ng AI-related Page 8 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 risks lies in proactive policy development, human-AI integration frameworks, and ongoing ethical oversight. This ensures that AI serves as an augmentative tool rather than a disruptive force, preserving human agency and expertise in an AI-driven world. 4. Human-AI Integrated Workflows: A Path to Augmented Expertise and Empowerment As AI continues to advance, human-AI integration is becoming a critical factor in shaping the future of expertise. AI systems can support human professionals in a wide range of tasks, from decision-making to creative problem-solving. However, the effectiveness of these collaborations depends on the design of workflows, the level of human oversight, and the trust placed in AI systems. A well-structured human-AI partnership can enhance human agency, but without careful implementation, it can also lead to unintended disempowerment. This section explores the principles and models of human-AI collaboration, focusing on both the challenges and opportunities they present. 4.1 The Rise of Collaborative Intelligence, Appropriate Trust, and Counteracting Disempowerment Understanding the varying effectiveness of human-AI collaboration across different tasks is crucial for developing successful collaborative frameworks. Research highlights that AI-human synergy is task-dependent, requiring structured interaction models to ensure optimal performance.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0959d249ab1a", "text": "asks is crucial for developing successful collaborative frameworks. Research highlights that AI-human synergy is task-dependent, requiring structured interaction models to ensure optimal performance. 4.1.1 Task-Dependent Nature of Human-AI Collaboration Recent studies emphasize that human-AI collaboration does not always lead to superior outcomes. Puerta-Beldarrain et al. (2025) found that AI-human synergy is highly task-dependent: \u2022 In creative tasks, such as content generation and ideation, AI augments human capabilities, improving efficiency and offering novel insights. \u2022 In decision-making tasks, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment, AI-human collaboration may reduce performance due to misalignment in cognitive strategies and over-reliance on AI-generated suggestions. Vaccaro, Almaatouq, and Malone (2024) further indicate that the effectiveness of AI assistance varies based on user expertise. Novice users often benefit more from AI-guided decision support, while experts may find AI outputs disruptive to their reasoning processes. Felin and Holweg (2024) highlight that AI relies on pattern recognition rather than causal reasoning, meaning that experts may struggle with AI-generated insights that lack explanatory depth. These distinctions highlight the necessity of task-specific AI integration strategies that enhance human performance rather than hinder it, ensuring that AI complements rather than disrupts expert workflows.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 22, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d3e6fe41bc98", "text": "stinctions highlight the necessity of task-specific AI integration strategies that enhance human performance rather than hinder it, ensuring that AI complements rather than disrupts expert workflows. 4.1.2 Essential Factors for Successful Collaboration Several key factors have emerged as critical determinants for achieving effective human-AI collaboration and maintaining appropriate trust levels. Page 9 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 Key Factors Shaping Human-AI Collaboration: \u2022 Complementary Strengths: Humans excel at critical thinking, ethical reasoning, complex problem-solving, and contextual understanding, while AI excels at data processing, pattern recognition, and speed. Felin and Holweg (2024) emphasize that AI lacks causal reasoning, reinforcing the need for human interpretation of results. \u2022 Hybrid Models: Hybrid Intelligence, emphasizing iterative interaction and user involvement, offers a promising model for empowering human experts (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025). \u2022 Increased Efficiency and Productivity: AI can automate routine and repetitive tasks, freeing up human experts for higher-level strategic work. \u2022 Improved Accuracy and Decision-Making: AI provides data-driven insights and reduces human error, particularly in structured environments. \u2022 Iterative Interaction: Ongoing feedback and communication are crucial for building trust, refining collaboration, and maintaining human control (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 23, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_86a41237a772", "text": "ctured environments. \u2022 Iterative Interaction: Ongoing feedback and communication are crucial for building trust, refining collaboration, and maintaining human control (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025). \u2022 Explainability: AI systems must be transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand the rationale behind decisions and adjust accordingly (Mehrotra et al. 2024). 4.1.3 Safeguarding Human Agency As AI systems become more advanced, the risk of human disempowerment grows. Kulveit et al. (2025) warn that improperly designed AI-driven workflows could lead to a gradual loss of human agency. To mitigate this risk, AI collaboration must be structured to enhance human influence rather than replace it: \u2022 Maintaining Human Oversight: Humans must retain meaningful decision-making authority, particularly in high-stakes applications. International Telecommunication Union (ITU. 2024) outlines safeguards for ensuring AI decisions remain explainable and contestable. \u2022 Designing AI for Empowerment: AI should function as an advisor or co-worker, rather than an autonomous decision-maker, ensuring that humans remain actively engaged (Vaccaro, Almaatouq, and Malone. 2024; Felin and Holweg. 2024). \u2022 Adaptive AI Interfaces: AI tools should be designed to adapt to human reasoning patterns rather than forcing human users to adjust to machine logic (Lin et al. 2024). \u2022 Trust Calibration Mechanisms: Encouraging users to critically assess AI outputs, reducing automation bias (Mehrotra et al.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 24, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e11fb9dd0ee1", "text": "her than forcing human users to adjust to machine logic (Lin et al. 2024). \u2022 Trust Calibration Mechanisms: Encouraging users to critically assess AI outputs, reducing automation bias (Mehrotra et al. 2024; Mitchell et al. 2025; Vaccaro, Almaatouq, and Malone. 2024). 4.1.4 Principles for Balanced Integration The successful integration of AI systems requires adherence to core principles that prioritize human empowerment while maximizing collaborative benefits: Page 10 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 \u2022 Cognitive Load Consideration: AI should enhance rather than replace human cognitive effort, as Mehrotra et al. (2024) highlight. If AI assumes too much autonomy, human operators may disengage, increasing the risk of automation complacency (Kulveit et al. 2025). \u2022 Adaptive Trust Mechanisms: Over-reliance on AI is a concern in high-ambiguity environments (such as medical diagnostics or strategic decision-making). Structured trust-building mechanisms, such as confidence scoring, explanations of uncertainty, and interactive AI, help mitigate automation bias (Mehrotra et al. 2024; Mitchell et al. 2025; Vaccaro, Almaatouq, and Malone, 2024; Uuk et al. 2024; Nguyen et al. 2024). It is also important to foster \u201cappropriate trust\u201d in AI systems (Mehrotra et al. 2024), ensuring users are neither overly skeptical nor blindly reliant. Data suggests that employees are more likely to trust their own companies to deploy AI responsibly (Mayer et al.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_de86676f5b65", "text": "ehrotra et al. 2024), ensuring users are neither overly skeptical nor blindly reliant. Data suggests that employees are more likely to trust their own companies to deploy AI responsibly (Mayer et al. 2025), which can be leveraged to build internal trust-building programs. By incorporating these principles, human-AI collaboration can be structured in a way that amplifies human expertise rather than diminishing it. This balanced approach ensures that AI remains a valuable augmentative tool rather than a force for displacement. 4.2 Types of Human-AI Integrated Workflows: A Focus on Empowerment The design of human-AI integrated workflows is crucial for determining whether AI augments human capabilities and preserves agency or contributes to gradual disempowerment (Kulveit et al. 2025). Different workflow types offer varying degrees of human control, involvement, and influence over the decision-making process. Mitchell et al. (2025) provide a valuable framework for understanding these variations by proposing a spectrum of AI agent autonomy, ranging from simple tools with no autonomy to fully autonomous agents capable of independent action and code creation. Understanding where a given workflow falls on this spectrum is crucial for assessing its potential benefits and risks. We categorize these workflows, analyzing their potential for both empowerment and disempowerment.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 26, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_929f569e40d8", "text": "re a given workflow falls on this spectrum is crucial for assessing its potential benefits and risks. We categorize these workflows, analyzing their potential for both empowerment and disempowerment. 4.2.1 AI as Assistant In this model, AI performs routine, time-consuming, or data-intensive tasks, freeing up human experts to focus on higher-level cognitive work, strategic decisions, and tasks requiring uniquely human skills (e.g., critical thinking, creativity, empathy). This type of workflow generally falls on the lower end of the autonomy spectrum, corresponding to Mitchell et al.\u2019s (2025) \u201cSimple Processor\u201d or \u201cRouter\u201d levels. The AI is primarily a tool under direct human control. \u2022 Examples: AI summarizing legal documents (Christman. 2024), scheduling appointments (Lin et al. 2024), filtering information, automating data entry. Many employees are already using AI as an assistant in their daily work (Mayer et al. 2025), indicating the growing prevalence of this workflow type. \u2022 Empowerment Potential: High, if designed correctly. By offloading tedious tasks, AI can enhance productivity and allow experts to focus on their core competencies. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and a greater sense of agency.

If the AI handles too much of the analytical work, the human expert may become a mere \u201crubber stamper,\u201d losing the opportunity to develop and exercise their own judgment. This relates to the value of accuracy (Mitchell et al. 2025), as over-reliance on an assistant with flawed capabilities can lead to errors. \u2022 Trust Mechanisms: Transparency and explainability (Mehrotra et al. 2024) are crucial to avoid over-reliance. Users need to understand why the AI is performing certain tasks and have the ability to override or adjust its actions. 4.2.2 AI as Advisor In this model, while the human expert retains ultimate decision-making authority, the AI provides data-driven insights, recommendations, and predictions to support that process. This increased AI involvement corresponds to a higher level of autonomy, such as the \u201cTool Call\u201d capability described by Mitchell et al. (2025). \u2022 Examples: AI suggesting treatment options in healthcare (Alowais et al. 2023), AI providing risk assessments in finance (Sheharyar. 2024), AI offering legal precedents in law. \u2022 Empowerment Potential: Moderate to high.

AI can provide valuable information and perspectives that the human expert may not have considered, leading to better-informed decisions. \u2022 Disempowerment Risk: Over-reliance on AI recommendations is a significant risk, particularly if the AI\u2019s reasoning is opaque or if the human expert lacks the confidence or expertise to critically evaluate the AI\u2019s output. This can lead to a gradual erosion of human judgment and expertise. Automation bias can also be a factor (Mehrotra, et. al. 2024). This relates to the values of truthfulness and accuracy (Mitchell et al. 2025), as reliance on flawed or biased recommendations can lead to poor decisions. \u2022 Trust Mechanisms: Appropriate trust is paramount (Mehrotra et al. 2024). Experts need to understand the AI\u2019s capabilities and limitations, and be able to calibrate their trust accordingly. Explainability is key: understanding why the AI is making a particular recommendation is crucial for informed decision-making. Mechanisms for challenging or overriding AI recommendations are also essential for maintaining human agency. 4.2.3 AI as Co-worker This model emphasizes iterative interaction and shared control between humans and AI. Humans and AI work together on tasks, each contributing their unique skills and expertise, and actively participating in the learning loop. This is best exemplified by the Hybrid Intelligence approach (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 29, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_1a6d37389c05", "text": "ks, each contributing their unique skills and expertise, and actively participating in the learning loop.

Lin et al. (2024) provide concrete examples of this in their \u201cdecision- oriented dialogue\u201d tasks, such as collaborative itinerary planning or multi-party meeting scheduling. Also, Nguyen et al. (2024) analyzed how students employed strategies in academic writing using generative AI. All these studies show how AI systems and humans can collaborate and co-work in iterative tasks. \u2022 Examples: The air quality awareness application (Guo et al. 2022), where users actively provide feedback, customize the system, and participate in the data collection and Page 12 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 analysis process.

Transparency and explainability are important, but active participation is the primary driver of trust (Mehrotra et al. 2024; Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025). 4.2.4 AI as Manager In this model, the AI system has significant autonomy in decision-making, with humans playing a limited oversight role. Humans may be involved in setting high-level goals or constraints, but the AI makes the majority of operational decisions. Alternatively, the human may be the executor of the low-level tasks. This corresponds to the highest levels of autonomy on the Mitchell et al. (2025) scale, approaching or achieving \u201cFully Autonomous Agent\u201d status. This is the level where Mitchell et al.

Different workflow models offer varying degrees of human control, involvement, and decision-making influence. While lower-autonomy AI systems (such as Assistants and Advisors) can enhance productivity and provide valuable insights, higher-autonomy systems (such as AI as Co-worker or AI as Manager) introduce significant risks that require careful trust mechanisms and human oversight (Mitchell et al. 2025). The gradual nature of disempowerment means that seemingly benign AI Page 13 of 32 Ministry of Labor, Doha, Qatar Research Team Feburary 15th, 2025 applications could, over time, contribute to a long-term erosion of human decision-making authority (Kulveit et al. 2025). To address these challenges, it is critical to evaluate AI systems across the full spectrum of autonomy, as proposed by Mitchell et al. (2025). Moving forward, AI workflows must be designed to preserve meaningful human control and agency, ensuring that AI functions as a tool for augmentation rather than displacement (Mitchell et al. 2025). 5. The Transformation of Expert Roles: Embracing Change and Maintaining Agency The rise of AI is not simply automating tasks; it is fundamentally reshaping the roles and responsibilities of human experts.

Human Resilience Strategies in the AGI Era: Preparing for an Uncertain Future The rapid advancement of AI, particularly the development of increasingly autonomous systems (Mitchell et al. 2025), presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges for specialized professions. While AI can automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and improve efficiency, it also poses systemic risks (Uuk et al. 2024) and the threat of gradual disempowerment (Kulveit et al.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 38, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_7e3358d43fb7", "text": "ized professions. While AI can automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and improve efficiency, it also poses systemic risks (Uuk et al. 2024) and the threat of gradual disempowerment (Kulveit et al. 2025), where human influence and control over critical systems could be eroded over time. This is a topic of growing debate (Pew Research Center, 2023). To navigate this uncertain future, individuals, organizations, and societies must prioritize human resilience strategies that focus on lifelong learning, effective human-AI collaboration, and proactive policy interventions. The increasing investment in AI (Mayer et al. 2025) underscores the urgency of developing these resilience strategies. 6.1 Lifelong Learning and Skill Development: The Adaptive Expert Continuous learning and skill development are no longer optional; they are essential for professionals to remain relevant and adaptable in an AI-driven world.

These strengths include: Key strategies include: \u2022 Creativity and Innovation: While AI can assist in creative tasks (Ivcevic and Grandinetti 2024), true innovation often requires the ability to think outside existing paradigms, make unexpected connections, and generate genuinely novel ideas. However, it is important to investigate whether AI models can achieve this, as some research shows that they can produce novel ideas and expand creative problem-solving through parallel exploration (Boussioux et al. 2024). Additionally, human involvement remains essential in guiding AI\u2019s creative outputs, refining ideas, and integrating insights into meaningful applications (Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2024). \u2022 Adaptability to new situations: While AI can be very usefull, it is crucial for humans to know how to deal with situations where there is no AI, or AI is failing.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_dff55a72a7dc", "text": "ications (Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2024). \u2022 Adaptability to new situations: While AI can be very usefull, it is crucial for humans to know how to deal with situations where there is no AI, or AI is failing. \u2022 Ethical Reasoning and Judgment: Humans possess a capacity for moral reasoning and ethical judgment that goes beyond simply following rules or maximizing predefined objectives. This is particularly important in complex and ambiguous situations where values and societal norms must be considered. \u2022 Emotional Intelligence and Empathy: Understanding and responding to the emotions of others, building relationships, and providing care and support are crucial aspects of human interaction that are difficult for AI to replicate. \u2022 Contextual Understanding and Common Sense: Humans have a deep understanding of the world and can apply common sense reasoning to navigate complex and unpredictable situations. This ability to contextualize information and make nuanced judgments is often lacking in AI systems. Investing in education, training, and cultural practices that cultivate these uniquely human strengths is crucial for ensuring that humans remain active and valuable contributors to society, even as AI takes on an increasingly prominent role. 7.

Policy Recommendations for Ensuring a Balanced AI- Driven Future The rapid advancement and deployment of AI technologies necessitate a proactive and comprehensive approach to policy-making. The goal is to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating the risks, particularly the potential for gradual disempowerment (Kulveit et al. 2025) and the erosion of human agency. Policy recommendations must address multiple levels, from individual skills and organizational practices to national regulations and international cooperation. A balanced approach will recognize the diverse perspectives and needs of stakeholders, promoting both innovation and responsible development (Pew Research Center. 2023), and must take into account the \u201cAI governance paradox\u201d (ITU. 2024). 8.1 Investing in Education and Training for the AI Era A foundational element of a balanced AI-driven future is a workforce equipped to navigate the changing landscape. This requires a fundamental shift in education and training, prioritizing AI and data literacy for all citizens (Pew Research Center, 2023). Curricula should not only cover the technical aspects of AI but also its capabilities, limitations, and ethical implications (Mehrotra et al. 2024).

Beyond foundational literacy, specialized training programs are needed to equip professionals with the skills to effectively collaborate with and oversee AI systems. This includes developing expertise in areas like prompt engineering (Lin et al. 2024), providing feedback, adapting to new workflows, and actively participating in the AI\u2019s learning loop (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025). Furthermore, a culture of lifelong learning must be fostered, encouraging continuous upskilling and reskilling to keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI technologies. This includes an emphasis on meta-skills such as learning how to learn, adaptability, and resilience (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025).

Ethical guidelines must emphasize human well-being, fairness, and accountability, particularly in high-stakes domains where the potential for harm is greatest (Mehrotra et al. 2024). A critical principle is maintaining human oversight and control through: \u2022 HITL and HOTL frameworks: As defined in Section 6.3, these approaches ensure that AI systems incorporate human supervision at different stages of operation, reinforcing accountability and trust (Maathuis 2024; Uuk et al. 2024; Mehrotra et al. 2024; ITU 2024). \u2022 Explainability requirements: AI systems must be transparent, allowing human operators to audit and challenge AI-generated decisions to prevent reliance on opaque decision-making models (Mehrotra et al. 2024). \u2022 Bias detection and mitigation: Regulatory mandates requiring AI audits for fairness, particularly in finance, healthcare, and hiring, to prevent discriminatory outcomes and algorithmic biases (Uuk et al. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 57, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_2626a5d79dc1", "text": "ion and mitigation: Regulatory mandates requiring AI audits for fairness, particularly in finance, healthcare, and hiring, to prevent discriminatory outcomes and algorithmic biases (Uuk et al. 2024). 8.2.2 Mapping Systemic Risks to Policy Solutions Each systemic risk outlined earlier aligns with specific regulatory interventions: \u2022 Loss of Control \u2192 Human-in-the-loop (HITL) requirements: To address the risks of loss of control, regulatory measures should ensure meaningful human oversight in high- stakes environments such as law enforcement and critical infrastructure. This aligns with concerns about the gradual erosion of human agency, as AI systems become increasingly embedded in decision-making processes (Kulveit et al. 2025). \u2022 Democracy Risks \u2192 Transparency and accountability mandates: To mitigate democracy risks, regulatory frameworks must enforce transparency, accountability, and oversight in AI-generated content, decision automation, and algorithmic governance. Research highlights the need for governance structures to prevent AI-driven erosion of democratic norms (Uuk et al. 2024). \u2022 Economic Disruption \u2192 Workforce adaptation policies: To address economic disruption, governments must implement reskilling initiatives and workforce adaptation strategies that equip professionals to work alongside AI systems.

Research suggests that human oversight remains indispensable to ensuring safety and accountability in AI-driven decisions (Mitchell et al. 2025). By aligning governance strategies with identified risks, AI policies can balance innovation, accountability, and human empowerment while mitigating existential threats. Ensuring AI remains an augmentative force rather than a destabilizing one requires proactive oversight and adaptable policy frameworks that leverage HITL and HOTL models effectively. 8.3 Supporting Workforce Adaptation The potential economic and social impacts of AI-driven changes in the labor market require proactive strategies to support workforce adaptation.

Policymakers should also consider social safety nets, such as universal basic income (UBI) or other support mechanisms, to address potential job displacement. Furthermore, exploring wealth redistribution mechanisms, such as wealth taxes, progressive taxation, or employee ownership models, may be necessary to mitigate increasing inequality. Investing in human-centric industries that leverage uniquely human capabilities, such as caregiving, education, and the arts, can create new job opportunities and promote a more balanced economy. 8.4 Cultivating a Culture of Human-AI Collaboration and Empowerment Ultimately, a balanced AI-driven future requires a shift in mindset, from viewing AI as a replacement for human capabilities to recognizing it as a tool for augmentation and collaboration. Promoting a positive and collaborative attitude towards AI, emphasizing its potential to enhance human capabilities, is crucial. This involves encouraging the development of Hybrid Intelligence workflows, which leverage the complementary strengths of humans and AI, allowing for iterative interaction, shared control, and active user participation (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025; Lin et al. 2024; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2024).", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 60, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_11a919187ae4", "text": "e complementary strengths of humans and AI, allowing for iterative interaction, shared control, and active user participation (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025; Lin et al. 2024; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2024). Fostering a culture of continuous learning, adaptation, and ethical reflection is essential for navigating the evolving landscape of human-AI interaction (Puerta-Beldarrain et al. 2025). 8.5 Enhancing Uniquely Human Capabilities 8.5.1 The Critical Need for Active Human Engagement The maintenance of human capabilities in an AI-driven world requires more than just robust governance and education; it demands active exercise of our uniquely human abilities. Even with robust AI governance, investment in education, and human-centered design principles, there remains a critical need to ensure that humans continue to actively exercise their uniquely human capabilities. The risk is not simply that AI will make bad decisions, but that humans will become overly reliant on AI, leading to a degradation of skills and a diminished capacity for independent thought and action.

While AI can undoubtedly augment human capabilities and improve efficiency, there is a danger that over-reliance on AI recommendations may reduce users\u2019 ability to critically assess information, leading to potential loss of judgment confidence and a decline in independent problem-solving behaviors. Studies have identified automation bias as a key factor contributing to these risks. If humans routinely defer to AI-generated decisions without critical evaluation, they may develop a habit of unquestioning acceptance, leading to inappropriate reliance on AI even in cases where human judgment is preferable. Research has shown that misplaced trust in automation can affect users\u2019 ability to exercise oversight and correction, reinforcing over-reliance on AI systems (Mehrotra et al. 2024). 8.5.3 Key Strategies for Maintaining Human Agency Preserving human capabilities requires deliberate strategies that go beyond traditional education and training approaches.

It requires seeking out challenges that require human ingenuity, creativity, and critical thinking. \u2022 Exercise independent judgment: Even when AI provides recommendations or insights, humans should be encouraged to critically evaluate those outputs, question the underlying assumptions, and make their own informed decisions. \u2022 Embrace \u201cproductive struggle\u201d: Learning and growth often require effort and even discomfort. AI systems should be designed to support this process, not to eliminate it entirely. \u2022 Seek out diverse perspectives: AI systems, even those trained on vast datasets, can reflect the biases and limitations of their training data. Humans must actively seek out diverse perspectives and challenge the assumptions embedded in AI systems. 8.5.4 Practical Implementation Approaches Several concrete methods can help maintain and enhance human capabilities in an AI- augmented environment.", "source": "R&D Report: research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "freshness": "2025-02-20", "chunk_index": 63, "total_chunks": 78, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\research_report_QX_EN_2025-02-20 2.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-02-20", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_5d95ce10c40b", "text": "challenge the assumptions embedded in AI systems. 8.5.4 Practical Implementation Approaches Several concrete methods can help maintain and enhance human capabilities in an AI- augmented environment. Examples of how this might be achieved in practice include: \u2022 Iterative Adversarial Testing: Actively testing AI systems through adversarial approaches, probing their weaknesses, and identifying potential failure modes aligns with iterative AI testing methods discussed in dialogue research (Lin et al. 2024).

It is important to acknowledge that some individuals may choose to offload tasks to AI, even if it means losing some skills. This is a personal choice, and there may be valid reasons for doing so. However, at a societal level, it is crucial to ensure that there are ample opportunities for humans to exercise their cognitive abilities and to maintain a high level of engagement with the world around them. In essence, maintaining human agency in an AI-driven world requires a conscious and deliberate effort to cultivate and preserve uniquely human capabilities. This is not just about preventing the negative consequences of over-reliance on AI; it\u2019s about ensuring that humans continue to thrive, innovate, and contribute to a meaningful future. 8.6 Qatar-Specific Policy Considerations Qatar\u2019s commitment to harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evident through its strategic initiatives and policies.

Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of over 10% from 2000-2011. Growth moderated after 2011 but remained strong, averaging 3.4% from 2015-2019 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qatar has among the highest per capita incomes globally. The economy rests overwhelmingly on hydrocarbon production and exports, which accounts for over 60% of GDP, 85% of export earnings, and 70% of government revenues. Efforts have been made to diversify the economy, including into financial services, transportation, tourism and manufacturing. However, progress has been constrained by the small domestic market. Current Conditions: Qatar's economy has rebounded from the pandemic with growth estimated at 4.6% in 2022, aided by higher oil and gas prices. The recovery was further boosted by Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, the World Bank projects growth will slow to 3.3% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024 as the boost from hydrocarbons and the World Cup fades. The non-hydrocarbon sector contributes around 40% of GDP.

The report also makes recommendations for how to prepare workers for the future of work. Introduction: The report begins by discussing the changing nature of work and the increasing pace of skill disruption. It notes that the skills required for many jobs are changing rapidly, as technology and other factors reshape the workplace. This trend is likely to continue in the future, creating new challenges and opportunities for businesses and workers alike. Methods: The report uses data from Emsi Burning Glass, which scans millions of job postings in the United States every day and analyzes them using artificial intelligence technologies. Drawing on data sourced from more than 15 million online job postings between 2016 and 2021, the report examined current skill requests as well as their evolution over time. Key Findings: \u30fb The growth of digital skills is not limited to jobs in IT. Roles across industries increasingly demand technical fluency and abilities.

Conclusion: The report concludes by arguing that governments have a critical role to play in unleashing the skills economy and ensuring that everyone has the skills they need to succeed in the digital and green age. The report also calls for a more coordinated global effort to address the skills gaps that are emerging in the wake of the twin transitions. Limitations: The report gives a useful snapshot of the challenges and opportunities in transitioning to a digital and green economy but misses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, regional differences, and the costs and political implications of its suggestions.

Introduction: In the World Economic Forum's \"The Future of Jobs 2023\" report, the impact of technology, globalization, and demographics on work is examined. The report reveals an accelerating pace of change in the work landscape, brought about by these factors. This shift presents both new opportunities and challenges for workers, including job displacement and the need for upskilling or reskilling. Methods: The World Economic Forum conducted research for The Future of Jobs 2023 using a variety of methods. They surveyed 30,000 employers from 150 countries to gather data on the skills that are in demand now and in the future. They also interviewed over 100 experts from business, academia, and government to get their insights on the future of work. Finally, they analyzed trends in technology, globalization, and demographics to identify the forces that are shaping the future of work. Key findings: The pace of change in the world of work is accelerating, driven by technological advances, globalization, and demographic trends. The skills that will be in demand in the future will be increasingly digital, technical, and social.

And the report identifies 10 key trends that are shaping the future of work: 1. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence: Technology is automating tasks that were once performed by humans. This is displacing some jobs, but it is also creating new opportunities for workers in areas such as data analysis, programming, and design. 2. The growth of the gig economy: The gig economy is characterized by short- term, freelance, or contract work. This is growing in popularity as workers seek more flexibility and control over their work. 3. The rise of remote work: Remote work is becoming more common as technology makes it easier for workers to collaborate and communicate from different locations. 4. The increasing importance of soft skills: Soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, are becoming increasingly important in the workplace. 5. The need for lifelong learning: The pace of change in the world of work is so rapid that workers need to be lifelong learners who can upskill and reskill as needed. 6.

It is important to put in place policies to ensure that everyone benefits from this transition. 8. The importance of creativity and innovation: In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, workers will need to be creative and innovative to succeed. This means being able to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and adapt to change. 9. The need for collaboration and teamwork: In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, workers will need to be able to collaborate and work effectively with others. This is because many tasks will require multiple people with different skills and expertise to complete. 10. The importance of ethics and responsibility: In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, workers will need to be ethical and responsible in their use of technology. This means using technology in a way that benefits society and does not harm others.

Skill anticipation is a systematic and strategic procedure of predicting future labour market demands and matching them with potential suppliers. In this respect, it informs all labor market actors about potential skill demands and shortages going forward. This helps avoid skill mismatches, enables informed and appropriate decision-making, and promotes the development of appropriate skills. Need for skill anticipation The world labour market is limited by the lack of appropriate skilled workers blocking further economic progress. The number of unemployed youths is on the rise while many employers report lack of skill-matched applicants. This skills gap is increasing economic and social costs and causing structural unemployment. Skills-job mismatches are an economic challenge, with many companies facing a shortage of workers with the right skills around the world.

These dynamic changes necessitate skill anticipation for appropriate response. What is skill anticipation? Skill anticipation is a series of processes which analyze future labor market trends and forecast the skill demands. It is aimed to provide information of future skills demands which will enable educational and training institutions, businesses, and governments to make efficient investment decisions and plans. Skill anticipation assesses the supply- demand balance in the labor market and supports decision-making to meet needs and avoid imbalances. Key Components of Skill Anticipation As one component of a broader labor market information system (LMIS), skills prognostication can be broken down into the following key elements: Data, Analytical methods, Tools, and Institutions. \u25a0 Data and Data Sources The labor force, education, and demographic data is compiled from a wide range of sources that provide central statistical agency information, unemployment and vacancy records at public employment security offices, household, and social surveys, as well as data from school records.

Through household and business surveys, data reflecting the demand for specific occupations and skills will also be collected. \u25a0 Analytical Methods Both quantitative and qualitative approaches will be employed. Macroeconomic modelling is used as quantitative approaches to predict sectoral and occupational employment. While qualitative techniques will use a combination of insights from multiple stakeholders, including focus groups, round tables, expert interviews, foresights, and scenario development in anticipation of the future. Other ways include establishment skills surveys for generating unique demand-side data on skill needs and skill utilization, tracer survey of school and training graduates, and school to work transition surveys. These methods are used in combination to predict future skill needs and potential outcomes. \u25a0 Tools The tool provides good practice on how to employ data, methods, and approaches in developing and implementing a system of skills anticipation. They must be interpreted and adapted to the country-specific context. \u25a0 Institutions The role of institutions in skills anticipation is established through the involvement and complementarity of diverse institutions like governments, educational institutions, and trade unions.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_Anticipating and matching skills and jobs.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_Anticipating and matching skills and jobs.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 7, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_Anticipating and matching skills and jobs.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_ad043b015721", "text": "utions The role of institutions in skills anticipation is established through the involvement and complementarity of diverse institutions like governments, educational institutions, and trade unions. Each of these institutions is required to promote the process of skills anticipation by contributing to data coverage and diffusion, offering multi-dimensional analyses, and creating an avenue for social dialogue. Therefore, some countries have set up national tripartite bodies to coordinate these efforts of the organizations. Skill gaps for specific sectors of industries will be addressed by special institutions of that industry. Sector-specific agencies also serve as a platform for dialogue involving stakeholders. In addition, employment service agencies also play a role in capturing short-term demand. Issues, Utilization, and Significance of Skill Anticipation It is difficult to provide reliable and consistent data in skills anticipation, select the appropriate methodologies, and also due to limited institutional capacities and available expertise. In particular such as developing countries a major issue is the large size of informal economy. There are also challenges of stakeholder commitment, incorporating grassroots information, and reflecting results in policy. Skills anticipation results are utilized for design and finance planning of educational and professional training programs, vocational guidance and counselling in careers, and policy making.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_Anticipating and matching skills and jobs.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_Anticipating and matching skills and jobs.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 7, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_Anticipating and matching skills and jobs.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_670f4b412976", "text": "policy.

The remarkable economic growth experienced by emerging economy such as South Korea and Singapore can be accredited to future-oriented skills strategies. In developed countries as well, strategies focused on skills and employment have achieved a reduction in skill mismatches and a reduction in inequality. For the case of using skill anticipation in solving actual problems and policymaking, it is important that it be promoted as a private-sector-led collaborative project with clear objectives and from the user's perspective. It should provide an avenue for social dialogue and be able to reflect the real voices of the frontlines in policy making. Only when it must be able to cover data from multiple perspectives, from macro to micro, and work in tandem with a network of competent experts, so that only then will it be possible to implement policies that capture the whole picture.

These days, countries all over the world are looking to develop a suitable workforce that is equipped with these critical skills to navigate this fast-paced environment. It is therefore essential that all individuals continually improve their skills in lifelong learning, enabling them to adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the labor market. The EU\u2019s New Skills and Employment Agenda seeks to foster life-long learning and develops a skilled workforce stocked with skills relevant to the labor market needs. A similar aim is held by the ILO which aims at matching skill supply demand, assisting workers and enterprises with adapting and building capability for labor market future needs. These goals position skill prediction and matching approaches as key elements of effective skill development systems.

ESSs can be a means of addressing skills gaps in the labour market, enhancing individual employability, contributing towards increased firm competitiveness, and supporting economic expansion at government level for policy makers and firms. Overview The labor market is now changing faster than it had ever been in history; hence, worldwide emphasis is placed on the importance of human capital, particularly that of the available skilled workforce. Though forecasting the required skills and creating a proficiently trained workforce equipped with appropriate competencies for meeting up the demands of labour market is not easy.

However, it is important to note that traditional workforce data centric approaches will not be able to adapt to changes as well as they would with the other methods of analysis discussed previously, and it must be stressed here as well that there still remain some shortfalls even when using those newer ways. ESS is a useful instrument that allows addressing the issue of the imbalance in skills between current and future labor force. the ESS is not only aimed at recognizing current and future skills required in the labour market as well as how the relationship between organizational characteristics and creating these skill needs could be studied. This may help in design of strategic plans on human resources management as well as designing appropriate vocational training. Although useful, ESS is associated with numerous conceptual and practical challenges from survey design to data analysis. It is necessary to choose sampling methods appropriately and make correct decision at every stage of the design, however it needs deep expertise and involvement of external specialists.

The Guidebook has already been used in Egypt, Tajikistan, and North Africa, and its usefulness as a government support tool and training material in the implementation of ESS has been confirmed. As they proceed in future, they plan cover some more countries and regions for this guideline book and apply it to a larger group of the population. Context and Preparation of the ESS Basic ESS Concepts: Definition and basic principles of ESS ESS is a firm survey where they identify the type, level, and composition of skills that individuals must have to do a workplace job and establish the real skill demand and investments in human resources\u2019 development.

Hence, there can also be thorough data on what skills employers prefer or what character do they desire in a worker coupled with how the company characteristics influence their skill demands. Knowledge derived from the ESS can be used for each institution to adjust their strategy and policies pertaining to skills supply. Typical examples are listed below. - A reference guide for policy makers to create educational and training policies. - Education and training institutions can set up skill development programs, skill requirements and offer them where needed in alignment with skill needs. - Companies can identify and address challenges and opportunities in their human resource development strategies. - Future skills would inform individuals\u2019 career development. As such, data collected from the ESS can be used by many actors in the labor market. It can help enhance the labour market through contributing to the development of skills and careers.

On the other hand, developing economies are seeking to build their labor market infrastructure by gathering ESS information on skills. For example, it is possible to mention Tunisia, Tajikistan, Egypt, where the initiation of ESS led several governmental departments to co-operate. Besides data collecting ESS also includes several advantages such as formulating human resource development policies as well as refining labour market structure. These benefits can only be realized if the different processes are followed accordingly. Background and Context in Which the ESS Is Needed The labor market is transforming, with the advent of rapid technological innovation and economic globalization. Human capital is becoming increasingly important in making productivity improvements and fostering innovations.

The use of ESSs as an alternative for addressing challenge that would adequately capture issues regarding skill demands in the firm\u2019s policy on human resources development, has become gaining attention as a new approach. Through this ESS, companies can identify both current job skills and future skill shifts as business operations change. Moreover, through an investigation on how company characteristics affect skills requirement, ESS may also furnish basic data useful for setting up data-based human resource development policies. Survey Planning and Implementation Considerations Project management in ESS has certain conceptual and technical difficulties. It is essential to see ESS as the sequence of processes from determining a problem, data collecting, policy planning, and implementation since this is what makes the proper planning and realization of the ESS possibility.

Such data is the type of information that has meaning only upon analysis. Therefore, institutional capacity to analyze the data and use it for policy purposes is essential. Country-specific factors that affect the ESS program\u2019s implementation should also be considered as well. For a successful ESS, multiple actors in the public and private sector must cooperate. They should plan on their respective roles and responsibilities and communicate effectively. Above all, strong leadership, both administrative and technical, is essential. Leaders have two roles: a political role in recognizing the importance of cooperation and ensuring that processes are established and a technical role as an element which ensures continued fulfillment of the technical aspect by all parties involved.

It is recommended that goals be set achievable and that the limitations of the survey be understood. Features of ESS ESS is characterized by the fact that the starting point is to envision a clear scenario in which the results will be used for policy making and decision making by the parties involved. First, the statement of the ESS\u2019s relevance to education and training and the employment policies should be clear and stakeholder usefulness should be guaranteed.

It is also characterized by determination of the growth patterns and characteristics of different job categories inside a company and analyzing trends in occupational change. When conducting this analysis, it is crucial to group employee skills by similar skills to evaluate the skill shortages and requirements. * Understanding the drivers of skill needs: Identifying the skill gaps companies are facing as well as providing suitable training and workforce development initiatives starts with understanding the factors impacting the skill needs.

Time Scope and Questionnaire Design * Defining the time scope of the survey Determining a time range is one of the key issues in implementing an ESS. There are considerations about the frequency and methods of conducting the survey, as well as related cost-effective aspects of the survey. 1. The time scope and repetition of the survey: The budget and survey design determine whether or not a survey is \u2022 conducted regularly. This in turn influences the policy being formulated. The use of Cross-sectional snapshot surveys that give data from a single \u2022 point in time are useful for understanding current conditions. However, the information may quickly become obsolete.

Benefits and costs of repeated surveys: One method of detecting changes over time is through annual surveys \u2022 which enable quick developing of policy measures. Repetitive survey can be viewed as a very costly, yet potent instrument of \u2022 tracking and forecasting skill requirements. Cost cutting measures include lengthening the survey period, narrowing \u2022 questionnaires, shortening version of the survey, and downsizing the sample size. 3. Selection of longitudinal data and panel data: Panel surveys tend to be rather costly and difficult to ensure continuous \u2022 representativeness when carried out as repetitive surveys over some period of time. In a longitudinal approach, surveys are typically repeated at different \u2022 establishments and are more flexible than panel surveys. 4. Employer-employee surveys as an alternative survey approach: The survey addresses a wide range of workplace issues by taking a \u2022 sample from different establishments and surveying employers as well as employees.

Skills questionnaire strategy There should be developed a system for effectively measuring workers\u2019 \u2022 skills. While they give clear data on the skill levels and contents of the workforce, \u2022 standardized test is expensive and time-consuming (in terms of design and running). A much easier-to-observe alternative is to use indicators such as \u2022 occupation, education level, and type of training. 2. Selection of the optimal approach Occupation-based approach: aiming to obtain a detailed map of an \u2022 organization's occupational structure. Occupations are usually well understood, but the diversity of occupations complicates the approach. Changes in the skill content of occupations over time as well as accurate and consistent coding also constitute concerns. Vacancy-based approach: ask for employers\u2019 opinions on current \u2022 vacancies and the reasons for them. Questions on the cause of the vacancies can help establish whether the vacancy is related to a lack of skills or competencies of the job applicant.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 14, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d7cdc830e8c6", "text": "ns on current \u2022 vacancies and the reasons for them.

This helps in providing timeously, information on employers\u2019 skill requirements as well as its directly assesses a business\u2019s needs. However, it is susceptible to economic bias fluctuations and the difficulty of predicting future needs. Training-based approach: Provides details regarding a company\u2019s training \u2022 as well as information on present and prospective skills requirements. However, it is difficult to establish a link between training content and skills. Task-based approach: Focusing on skills required to perform a task. \u2022 However, the complexity of setting up and preparing the survey is a challenge due to the diversity of tasks and the need to make comparisons across companies. The other point is also on whether employers have information to respond appropriately to questions concerning the employee\u2019s duties. Skills-based approach: Directly asking questions concerning the use of a \u2022 certain set of skill lists and rate them according to significance or frequency of use. There is concern that a generic skills list may exclude investigation of job-specific skills. As discussed above, there are several methods to questionnaire design. Each technique is complementary to the other as it provides a different perspective and type of information.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 15, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_e8002f6020e7", "text": "ob-specific skills. As discussed above, there are several methods to questionnaire design. Each technique is complementary to the other as it provides a different perspective and type of information. As such, instead of using only one approach, several recommended be combined depending on what the study is meant to achieve. 3. Determination of information sources The entity providing information on skills needs to be determined. \u2022 Preferably, information should come from employee data across the \u2022 establishment. Although it involves complex survey design and implementation that would be challenging within large firms and different professions. The process needs to be simplified by categorizing workers into groups \u2022 and obtaining information about groups rather than individual workers. 4. Clustering of workers In the case of the cluster of workers, the questionnaire design is about \u2022 how specific it defines the occupation. The occupations are classified hierarchically into classes using a system like the ISCO, comprising of the highest category that includes more than 100 different occupations downwards up to specific single occupations. Specifically, by using an intricate classification, the research collects data that is highly accurate with regards to occupational or technical skills as well as more homogeneous groups. However, this approach has the disadvantage of increased cost and complexity.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 16, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f07aba88718b", "text": "ollects data that is highly accurate with regards to occupational or technical skills as well as more homogeneous groups. However, this approach has the disadvantage of increased cost and complexity. In contrast, using coarse occupational classifications will offer simpler and \u2022 quicker data collection procedures but lower granularity of the information acquired. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate level of occupation classification for the purpose and resources is a vital element in questionnaire design. In most situations, it may only involve some of the occupational groups \u2022 and not all workers since time frames are limited. Occupational groups are normally chosen according to statistics, management strategy, or at their own discretion by the employer. 5. Core employability skills and job-specific (technical) skills Finally, another crucial issue in designing the questionnaire is on what \u2022 kinds of skills should it focus? When clustering workers based on their occupations there is a risk of mixing skills among different workers in broad occupational categories. As a result, it becomes challenging to do an in-depth appraisal on specific job-specific skills. Core employability skills are basic skills that are required regardless of the \u2022 type of occupation, are related to general employability, and are useful throughout a worker's career.

Occupation-specific skills, on the other hand, refer to skills and expertise specific to a particular occupation. The survey designers should appropriately combine these fundamental \u2022 and occupation-specific skills to carry out thorough examinations and analyses in line with labour market needs. * Questionnaire Design The questionnaire should be divided into different modules that reflect the specific areas of interest of the survey. Some of these modules are employee information, recruitment, workforce competency, workforce development, demand for workforce, and business planning. While these are the core information that you should aim to capture in the ESS, you do not necessarily need to include all modules. They are selected based on a scope balancing approach that combines cost, data, and technical aspects as well as quality and quantity of information. Shorter surveys are geared towards accessing a large sample in a short time period and at lower costs. Other modules can be included as per specific interests, these however are dependent on purpose of the survey.

Module 6 - business strategy and structure Collect data on current and existing skill demand to classify firms into skills \u2022 intensive and less skilled firms. Key factors such as the type of products and services, work organization, \u2022 and process technology relevant to the management strategies employed by the firms will be explored. A list of questions should be developed to balance survey time and \u2022 information volume. * Sampling in ESS Purpose and importance of the sampling strategy: ESS\u2019s sampling entails defining the target population and coming up with a suitable sample frame for selection of the establishments or firms to be surveyed. 1. Definition of Population The survey population is a group that includes all the subjects who can \u2022 provide the information we want. In setting up the survey population, the challenge is to find an accurate \u2022 definition of the target population and to comprehensively list all the subjects and select an appropriate sample frame.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_22b4d305a612", "text": "t.

(a) Identification of establishments: The focus for ESS analysis is generally on \u201cestablishment\u201d level. (b) Identification of family businesses: Since family businesses differ from typical commercial corporations, they recommend be excluded in the survey. However, since the establishment or enterprise is perfectly legal, it is difficult to separate them from regular enterprises. (c) Identification of the informal economy: The informal economy is a place of business that is invisible to administrative control. Statistical techniques are difficult to design and apply when working with them. Nevertheless, failing to acknowledge the existence of the informal economy gives rise to certain difficulties on an attempt to comprehend the current status of the sector. Its significance should be appreciated, and an understanding of such issues as efforts/benefits required for its inclusion in the survey is required. (d) Identifying the size of establishments: inclusion of microenterprises (typically 1-5 employees) will increase the cost of sampling and data collection. 2.

(a) Limitations of probabilistic sampling: sample implies that a particular group of establishments are to interview while sample frame is a comprehensive list of such establishments. Without a complete list, proper probabilistic sampling becomes difficult, and the quality of the sample frame must be checked. The major concerns should include incomplete lists (undercoverage), incorrectly included establishments (overcoverage), duplication, lack of accessibility, and misinformation, and to take steps to minimize these. (b) If no sample frame is available: In the case where there isn\u2019t a suitable sample frame, or the deficiencies are too serious, other methods besides probability sampling should be used. Other techniques include list building, redefining a survey population, and using other Census survey data. Nevertheless, these approaches can result in improper statistical inferences. In this context, one must construct the most representative sample frame reasonably possible or reshape or use whatever available data with precision so as to make valid statistical statements.

Fieldwork logistics: they should also conduct fieldwork effectively within the set-out scope and ensure their budget limits encompass all necessary logistics. The main outline of the whole survey should be clearly specified in the plan. 4. Conducting data collection: Mostly, such interviews are done at the physical location of businesses either by the employer or somebody who is senior. Such persons may be reluctant to disclose confidential information. For successful data collection, it is effective to gain trust and interest through direct engagement with employers. 5. Trial survey: This is done prior to commencement of the actual survey. Questions are checked for comprehension, response times, and consistency in their answers through informal internal checks and actual field pilots. 6. Data handling: The data handling process is critical to ensuring the accuracy and security of the data collected. Multiple steps in the process contribute significantly to data quality. (a) Computer-assisted interviewing: increases data precision and reduces time and cost.

Errors with respect to inconsistency, missing values and outliers should always be centrally checked. (b) Data storage: centralized management is recommended. It reduces technical complexity and the risk of errors during data transfer due to communication failures. Databases should be checked centrally to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Once data has been entered, stored, and checked, it must be anonymized to protect personal information. (c) Coding of open-ended questions: due to the issue of the difficulty of quantification and centralized coding, special attention is required in the data entry stage. Consistency in the interpretation of responses can be achieved by consultations between interviewers and establishment of the common coding strategy. These measures are vital for guard against loss or modification of the data prior processing of the post-collected information. Data must maintain consistency, reliability, and security.

However, there is a relationship between each country's level of development and its experience in implementing foresight. Where there is no political stability, fostering a culture of foresight becomes daunting and such an approach runs at high risks of not being implemented sustainably. The cultural context also matters in selection of methods, as there are known differences in preferred methods between the West and the East. It is essential to consider variations in labour market supervision as well. In an undeveloped institutional context, it is more likely to be difficult to translate foreseen results into policies and strategies. Similar is the case of resource bottlenecks.

The reason is that stakeholders having a feeling of belongingness and possession, they are expected to implement the findings. In addition, effective dissemination of results is also important. Considering the foresight objective of decision support, results must get to respective decision makers. To achieve this, the findings could be made public on a website or a report or through stakeholder workshops. The above three points form the basic pillars of what is referred to as common success factors. Ensuring these will be key to the success or failure of foresight. PART B: Key Insights from the Skills Forecast Summary of What Skills Forecast The objective of skills forecasting is to provide information to players in the labour market, as well as the education and training stakeholders, so that the market should work efficiently.

Skills forecasting start with the Mediterranean regional project that took place in the 1960s, and analyses of skill demand and supply forecasts have been developed since the 1980s. Skill forecasting usefulness is no longer in its predictive power, but in the informed ability which it provides to address future imbalances. It is essential to comprehend that quantitative models are not magical; therefore, we should understand what they can and cannot do. Advantages of a Quantitative Approach - Explicitly and transparently lays out assumptions about the future. - Supports systematic and logical thinking. - Acts as meeting point for intellectual discussion. - Provides counterfactual information for judging policy implications. - Provides detailed employment and skills information by sector, enabling the formulation of concrete policies. - Analyses the performance of an entire economy both at a macro and a micro level. - Enables to develop reasonable predictable futures with the use of historical and existing information. - Capable of developing sound plans that are based on the realities or restrictions facing it; e.g., financial and labor constraints.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 30, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_3dea64ac552e", "text": "able futures with the use of historical and existing information. - Capable of developing sound plans that are based on the realities or restrictions facing it; e.g., financial and labor constraints. - Modeling the effect and interplay with external factors like technology change.

Quality of the data determines the quality of the result, and while quantitative approaches are resource-intensive, it takes less time and at affordable costs, if already existing models are used. General Approach to Skill Prediction There are four main general approaches to skills forecasting: employer questionnaires, quantitative modelling, industry specific surveys and qualitative investigations. The surveys directly asking employers for skill shortages and so on are near real but subjective. Though quantitative modeling is comprehensive and consistent it involves a lot of data, that is costly. While sector-specific surveys could be modified with respect to the peculiarities of separate industries, they might not go together with the general one. Qualitative methods are more likely to reflect the opinions of those directly involved but tend to be less systematic and subjective. The quantitative model may involve range from simple trend extrapolation from historic data or a more complex method using time series analysis and behavioral theories. The process involves construction of simplified models of social phenomena presented as algebraic equations, which serve the purpose of predicting future scenarios.

These will provide comprehensive quality skills forecasts which address the lag that exist between the actual demand changes and the policies formulation and implementation response. Data collection and modeling approach Data collection The initial set of primary data required in predicting skills include: output and factor inputs by sector; employment by occupation, education/industry; demographics; and education information. These data usually collected for a particular period depend on the nature of data concerned as well as the purpose. Statistical surveys, which include labour force surveys, census, employer surveys among others and administrative data are employed in collecting data. Administrative dataset could also help make quantitative projections at the level of occupation and education not covered by the statistical surveys.

Attention should equally be directed into the consistency of the time series data as well as classifying different data sources. Modeling Approach The different modelling approaches vary, ranging from pure extrapolation methods, those related with time series analysis and theoretical considerations. The better choice is a large-scale macroeconomic model showing modifications in macroeconomy. However, due to data and resources restrictions the more simplified models targeting employment changes could be used. Macro models are an important component of quantitative future projections. Macro model has one advantage; important interactions may be included in the model. This helps in evaluating various economic cases and policy simulations. - E3ME or economic and social model for Europe is a set of models used by the European commission in their Skills project. Each European country is treated as one of several regional economic areas that form Europe together. - In the case of nations where statistics are lacking, a more streamlined structural model like that of Hermin is more applicable; Hermin presupposes an economy with a small trade and emphasizes on traded and intractable areas, pricing mechanisms, and influences from the labour market and public sector.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 34, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_da1b0e9daf7e", "text": "ermin is more applicable; Hermin presupposes an economy with a small trade and emphasizes on traded and intractable areas, pricing mechanisms, and influences from the labour market and public sector. - Models based on input-output tables and social accounting matrices can be used for developing and developed countries, they require low amounts of data. They are well suited for modeling the impact of changes in final demand on production and employment. The Lotus model for Vietnam is a good example of an inter- industry macroeconomic model that forecasts employment by industry. It is necessary to employ a blend of quantitative models with qualitative methods and expert judgment due to uncertainties that come along with forecasting. According to the circumstances in each country, they need to be combined differently, for example through interpretation of quantitative forecast results or by directly putting them into forecast model. However, no matter what they are, they all carry out the same process of drawing a conclusion by making prediction based on some sort of models which use past and current data. The modeling methodology and data are intertwined, as good data is important for skill anticipation.

However, it cannot be easily constructed because it demands both data and information concerning behavioral selectivity determinants and is often limited to analyses focused on the stock of educational attainment. Research at the macroeconomic level suggests that factors such as GDP growth, wages, and employment rates affect average education levels across countries. Employment change The overall employment level by industry is derived from a macroeconomic model and can be transformed into occupational and qualification demand. Transformation may occur through various ways such as fixed share or regression trend estimation; Cedefops use of econometric specification within expanded demand may be considered as demand sides-oriented approach because it is based on net employment changes over any given period.

Specific issues in skills modelling Technological change - There could occur changes in the economic structure brought about by technical innovation, among others. These changes would include modifications of sectors, occupations, and qualifications. - The Dutch and UK studies used time-series econometric models to establish the main factors influencing shifts in required skills. - It was revealed that high-skill occupations were complemented with new technology, and also medium skilled jobs with capital. Skill mismatch - One of the most significant issues aimed to solve by skills forecasting. It is a phenomenon that takes place through overeducation and undereducation. - The trend toward higher education leads to a state of oversupply when the required skills are not rising proportionately to those qualified, punishing educated workers by penalizing their wage. - Under-education implies that there is a low investment in human capital which results into lower productivity.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 37, "total_chunks": 45, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AN ESTABLISHMENT SKILLS SURVEY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_287beb5b4adf", "text": "oportionately to those qualified, punishing educated workers by penalizing their wage. - Under-education implies that there is a low investment in human capital which results into lower productivity. - There are \u201ctemporary mismatches\u2019 due to short-turned-out information and \u201clong- term mismatches\u201d due to structural gap resulting from demand-supply of skills. - Temporarily occurring mismatches can be helped by information improvement, but long-term mismatches require strategic adjustment of the educational system.

However, it should be noted that there is a very strong reliance on specialists within predicting approaches. Thus, policy makers need to appropriately match the outcome as projected on skills development with their policy on education and employment. Educators are also required to respond fast by including anticipated change in skill demand in their curriculum. Experts are expected to focus on improving methods and promoting the interpretation and use of results. The most critical component is the establishment of an interface linking skill anticipation with education policy.

It is designed to aid the creation of a model to anticipate future demands for skills to avoid skills mismatches. Skills impact positively into growth of economy, directly through increase of productivity or indirectly as innovations and technological changes. However, skill shortage or their mismatch act as limiting factors in growth. Education and training play a central role in providing all individuals the opportunity to continuously develop skills in terms of lifelong learning that can adapt to the requirements and conditions of a rapidly changing labor market. When people are making decisions on what type of education and training should be offered to the future work force, they will have to look at the future outlook, fill up any information gap and avoid later imbalances and mismatches.

A holistic approach of technological and economic trends will be preferred but a skills particular approach may work effectively for certain situations. The evolution of foresight is a process involving five steps. Since third generation, it fits perfectly with the skills agenda owing to its wide engagement of stakeholders, inclusive approach to policy matters, and broad focus. In the beginning It was targeted at higher qualification and after expanding its application into social policy it covers any level and form of education. Skills foresight is used because in today\u2019s rapidly changing knowledge-based economy multiple stakeholders affect the production of skills. There is a moving away from such centralized supporting approach which had been in existence for many years toward an approach for various stakeholders to take the right decisions.

Overview of Foresight and Scenario Methods There are three main types of foresight methods: exploratory, normative, and complementary. Exploratory methods for deriving future developments from current assumptions. Typical approaches include Delphi Method, Scenario Analysis among others, and even Cross Impact analysis. Normative methods refer to a set of tools that move backwards from the vision of the future and the desired objective to the appropriate measures within this moment. The complementary ones include literature review, SWOT analysis and brainstorming. * Literature Statistical Review Characteristics: Typically done in the initial stages of the foresight process. This first step of the foresight process involves collecting previous as well as existing knowledge, offering basic data. Accumulation of knowledge and converting raw data into information.

This means that it conceptualizes a desired picture of what the future should look like; moving backwards from that image to the present; and finally evaluating the necessary action plans, policies and programs that must be in place at present so as to link this present with that future. To have a vision of the desired long-term scenario, it will be necessary to include stakeholders at the initial level of the process. Alternative routes towards achieving the desired vision are then suggested. This leads to formulation of an action plan based on alternative pathways that are carefully considered and deliberated upon collectively by all stakeholders. Pros: Can creatively formulate a desirable vision of the future, not just an extension of the status quo Cons: Concerns about feasibility.

Some of these methods face challenges such as time and budgetary limits and subjective nature that may also result in creativity loss through simplification. However, it has been observed in international examples of Foresight that using just one method or framework is not the most efficient approach. For the Foresight goals to be realized, relevant methods should be chosen and used in synergy depending on the circumstance. There are selection criteria which require the researcher to be aware of fitness for purpose, available resources, participants, data demands, and methodological competence. One should also consider the cultural, economic, political, social, and institutional context of the field. The strengths and weaknesses of such methods should complement each other and must be tailor-made based on the particularities of a certain situation. Key steps in the implementation of a foresight program Foresight Program is a one which helps present day decision making in view of unclear future.

Particularly, the stakeholders\u2019 commitments are normally inadequate. Recommended practices include clear objective setting, effective operational management as well as accurate use of results. Ensuring these is the key to success. Adaptation of Foresight to Local Needs Some case studies of foresight activities across different countries indicate that foresight should be approached as a country level considering national specifics and their opportunities and barriers. The size of a country influences the complexity and management costs involved in foresight activities. In smaller countries, dealing with spatial skill mismatch is also a challenge.

The cultural context also matters in selection of methods, as there are known differences in preferred methods between the West and the East. It is essential to consider variations in labour market supervision as well. In an undeveloped institutional context, it is more likely to be difficult to translate foreseen results into policies and strategies. Similar is the case of resource bottlenecks. Under these limitations, it is important to set goals carefully and not to expand the scope of activities too much. The mixture of methods to be employed must also suit a given country\u2019s situation; it has to relate to specific goals for forecasting established and reflect the nature of the study\u2019s method.

Success Factors in Implementing Foresight Goal setting forms one of the common factors of success in foresight implementation. It is important to set reasonable goals and scope of activities and to position them realistically without being overly ambitious. The lack of adequate expertise and statistical data may cause failure towards the success of foresight activities; thus, the goals and scope should be set in such a manner as they balance available resources and projected results. This will ensure that progress can be made. Second, the commitment and involvement of a wide range of experts as well as more general stakeholders, such as industry and labor unions, is essential. The reason is that stakeholders having a feeling of belongingness and possession, they are expected to implement the findings. In addition, effective dissemination of results is also important.

PART B: Key Insights from the Skills Forecast Summary of What Skills Forecast The objective of skills forecasting is to provide information to players in the labour market, as well as the education and training stakeholders, so that the market should work efficiently. It may be impossible to systematically predict the way in which skill needs change over time but both governments, employers, schools, and individuals should plan assuming a certain number of anticipations. The need for labor market information and analysis varies widely from subject to subject and forecast period lengths depend on specific objectives. Hence, one needs to determine who is doing it, when they are doing it, why they are doing it and to whom they are doing it. Skills forecasting start with the Mediterranean regional project that took place in the 1960s, and analyses of skill demand and supply forecasts have been developed since the 1980s.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING SKILLS FORESIGHTS, SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS  GUIDE TO ANTICIPATING AND MATCHING SKILLS AND JOBS VOLUME 2  .pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING SKILLS FORESIGHTS, SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS  GUIDE TO ANTICIPATING AND MATCHING SKILLS AND JOBS VOLUME 2  .pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 17, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING SKILLS FORESIGHTS, SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS  GUIDE TO ANTICIPATING AND MATCHING SKILLS AND JOBS VOLUME 2  .pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_86227c5a8918", "text": "hey are doing it.

It is essential to comprehend that quantitative models are not magical; therefore, we should understand what they can and cannot do. Advantages of a Quantitative Approach - Explicitly and transparently lays out assumptions about the future. - Supports systematic and logical thinking. - Acts as meeting point for intellectual discussion. - Provides counterfactual information for judging policy implications. - Provides detailed employment and skills information by sector, enabling the formulation of concrete policies. - Analyses the performance of an entire economy both at a macro and a micro level. - Enables to develop reasonable predictable futures with the use of historical and existing information. - Capable of developing sound plans that are based on the realities or restrictions facing it; e.g., financial and labor constraints. - Modeling the effect and interplay with external factors like technology change.

Overall, however valuable quantitative methods may be as a basis for a comprehensive analysis of emerging skills requirements, they are also accompanied by data and model limitations. Thus, Qualitative methods should be brought together with these approaches. Quality of the data determines the quality of the result, and while quantitative approaches are resource-intensive, it takes less time and at affordable costs, if already existing models are used. General Approach to Skill Prediction There are four main general approaches to skills forecasting: employer questionnaires, quantitative modelling, industry specific surveys and qualitative investigations. The surveys directly asking employers for skill shortages and so on are near real but subjective.

Qualitative methods are more likely to reflect the opinions of those directly involved but tend to be less systematic and subjective. The quantitative model may involve range from simple trend extrapolation from historic data or a more complex method using time series analysis and behavioral theories. The process involves construction of simplified models of social phenomena presented as algebraic equations, which serve the purpose of predicting future scenarios. Contrary to this, qualitative method encompasses; interview, case study, focus group, roundtable, and scenario building. Although these are highly subjective, they may provide innovative perspectives.

These data usually collected for a particular period depend on the nature of data concerned as well as the purpose. Statistical surveys, which include labour force surveys, census, employer surveys among others and administrative data are employed in collecting data. Administrative dataset could also help make quantitative projections at the level of occupation and education not covered by the statistical surveys. Detailed information about skills and qualifications are obtainable also through different skills surveys. Each of them has its strengths and weaknesses and it\u2019s recommended to apply combination of several types of sources. Attention should equally be directed into the consistency of the time series data as well as classifying different data sources. Modeling Approach The different modelling approaches vary, ranging from pure extrapolation methods, those related with time series analysis and theoretical considerations.

However, due to data and resources restrictions the more simplified models targeting employment changes could be used. Macro models are an important component of quantitative future projections. Macro model has one advantage; important interactions may be included in the model. This helps in evaluating various economic cases and policy simulations. - E3ME or economic and social model for Europe is a set of models used by the European commission in their Skills project. Each European country is treated as one of several regional economic areas that form Europe together. - In the case of nations where statistics are lacking, a more streamlined structural model like that of Hermin is more applicable; Hermin presupposes an economy with a small trade and emphasizes on traded and intractable areas, pricing mechanisms, and influences from the labour market and public sector. - Models based on input-output tables and social accounting matrices can be used for developing and developed countries, they require low amounts of data.

It is necessary to employ a blend of quantitative models with qualitative methods and expert judgment due to uncertainties that come along with forecasting. According to the circumstances in each country, they need to be combined differently, for example through interpretation of quantitative forecast results or by directly putting them into forecast model. However, no matter what they are, they all carry out the same process of drawing a conclusion by making prediction based on some sort of models which use past and current data. The modeling methodology and data are intertwined, as good data is important for skill anticipation. Components of Skills Forecasting Supply The stock flow model could be thought to be most suitable to analysis of variation and forecasting in number of formal qualification holders. Such an approach could consider qualified enrolments and economic activity rate movements over medium- and long- term, as well as retirement or related \u201coutflows\u201d from the active population.

Research at the macroeconomic level suggests that factors such as GDP growth, wages, and employment rates affect average education levels across countries. Employment change The overall employment level by industry is derived from a macroeconomic model and can be transformed into occupational and qualification demand. Transformation may occur through various ways such as fixed share or regression trend estimation; Cedefops use of econometric specification within expanded demand may be considered as demand sides-oriented approach because it is based on net employment changes over any given period. Replacement needs Replacement demand refers to job replacement demand resulting in permanent or semi-permanent job loss due to retirement, move, death, etc. Demographic, labor force participation rate, and outflow by occupation and education data are required for forecasting.

Specific issues in skills modelling Technological change - There could occur changes in the economic structure brought about by technical innovation, among others. These changes would include modifications of sectors, occupations, and qualifications. - The Dutch and UK studies used time-series econometric models to establish the main factors influencing shifts in required skills. - It was revealed that high-skill occupations were complemented with new technology, and also medium skilled jobs with capital. Skill mismatch - One of the most significant issues aimed to solve by skills forecasting. It is a phenomenon that takes place through overeducation and undereducation. - The trend toward higher education leads to a state of oversupply when the required skills are not rising proportionately to those qualified, punishing educated workers by penalizing their wage. - Under-education implies that there is a low investment in human capital which results into lower productivity. - There are \u201ctemporary mismatches\u2019 due to short-turned-out information and \u201clong- term mismatches\u201d due to structural gap resulting from demand-supply of skills.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_DEVELOPING SKILLS FORESIGHTS, SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS  GUIDE TO ANTICIPATING AND MATCHING SKILLS AND JOBS VOLUME 2  .pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_DEVELOPING SKILLS FORESIGHTS, SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS  GUIDE TO ANTICIPATING AND MATCHING SKILLS AND JOBS VOLUME 2  .pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 25, "total_chunks": 33, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_DEVELOPING SKILLS FORESIGHTS, SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS  GUIDE TO ANTICIPATING AND MATCHING SKILLS AND JOBS VOLUME 2  .pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_632e5660a3a7", "text": "which results into lower productivity. - There are \u201ctemporary mismatches\u2019 due to short-turned-out information and \u201clong- term mismatches\u201d due to structural gap resulting from demand-supply of skills. - Temporarily occurring mismatches can be helped by information improvement, but long-term mismatches require strategic adjustment of the educational system. Imbalances - In theory as well as in practice, it is not possible to directly compare the anticipated supply with actual demand. They can only be directly comparable when carried out at the same time with the use of common data and methods. - Canada defines imbalance as the quantitative difference between demand and supply by occupation and Australia by educational stage. - The Dutch methodology excludes minor differences that can be automatically corrected and identified only major imbalances. - Imbalance indicators only provide an extension of the status quo and are difficult to predict as a result of the complex labor market adjustment process.

Previously, the focus was primarily on machines replacing physical tasks. The discussion has now evolved to encompass machines taking over thinking tasks, often associated with office jobs. While the public begins to realize the potential of AI through tools like ChatGPT, there remains a mix of excitement and concerns regarding the future of work. Purpose: The study aims to bring a global perspective to the ongoing debate on potential changes in labor markets due to the recent emergence of generative AI technologies. It endeavors to quantify the potential exposure of various occupations to technologies akin to GPT-4, laying the groundwork for proactive policy formulation to manage transitions fairly and with informed strategies. Methodology: The study relies on the international occupational classification ISCO-08, using the 436 occupations at the 4-digit level and their corresponding tasks. It uses the GPT-4 model to estimate task-level scores of exposure to generative AI technology.

The scores are linked to ILO employment data to derive global and country income group estimates of exposed jobs. Key Findings: - For clerical support workers, 24% of tasks are highly exposed to automation by GPTs, with an additional 58% moderately exposed. This occupational group faces the highest risk. - For other broad occupational groups, the share of highly exposed tasks is much smaller, ranging from just 1-4% of tasks. - When looking at augmentation potential rather than just automation, the picture changes. Globally, augmentation affects a greater share of employment than automation. - In high-income countries, 13.4% of total employment is in occupations with high augmentation potential, compared to only 5.5% facing high automation potential. - The potential effects are highly gendered. In high-income countries, 7.9% of women's employment is in high automation risk occupations, over double the 2.9% share for men. - In developing countries, potential exposure is far lower, with only 0.4% of employment in low-income countries facing high automation risk.

The Majority platform uses AI to analyze user data and provide personalized career advice (Majority platform, 2022). 3. Process Automation: Administrative tasks in education like enrolment and scheduling can be automated using AI to improve efficiency. The University of Auckland automated course advice and enrolment processes, reducing staff workload (Explorance, 2016). 4. Bias Mitigation: AI can help reduce biases in hiring, admissions and job matching processes. HireVue updated its AI algorithms in 2022 to further minimize algorithmic bias in video interview assessments (HireVue, 2022). Challenges: 1. Digital Divide: Unequal digital access prevents some groups from using AI-enabled education and career platforms, increasing inequality. A 2022 UNICEF study found 2/3 of school children globally lack home internet access (UNICEF, 2020). 2. Data Protection: Student and job seeker data risks exposure or misuse without proper protections. In 2022, Yocket exposed private data of 15 million users due to insufficient safeguards. (SC Media, 2019). 3. Algorithmic Bias: Biases in training data and design can lead AI systems to make discriminatory decisions. A 2022 audit found LinkedIn's job promotion algorithm favored candidates with male gendered names and profiles, recommending some jobs mainly to men (MIT Technology Review, 2021). 4.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_Generative AI and Jobs- A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality_YY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_Generative AI and Jobs- A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality_YY.pdf", "doc_type": "ai_impact_study", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "generative_ai", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 12, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_Generative AI and Jobs- A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality_YY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "ai_impact_study"}, {"doc_id": "rd_caeb0e41deb9", "text": "atory decisions.

Jobs at Risk: AI automation can displace jobs, especially routine and repetitive work. Automating tasks endangers jobs, necessitating strategies as automation threatens repetitive work (McKinsey Global Institute, 2019). 5. User Trust: Lack of AI transparency erodes trust, requiring communication and ethics training. In 2022, Meta (formerly Facebook) was fined \u20ac1.5 million by the European Union for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by failing to be transparent about how it was collecting and using personal data to target users with ads (The Guardian, 2023). 6. Regulatory Struggles: Attempts to regulate AI in hiring and education have struggled to keep up with the technology. Laws struggle to keep pace with AI's complexity, though strict rules are emerging (EU Parliament, 2023). To summarize, while generative AI brings many opportunities to enhance labor market information systems, it also poses risks around inclusion, ethics and job security that necessitate judicious governance, capacity building and social dialogue for smooth adoption.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_Generative AI and Jobs- A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality_YY.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_Generative AI and Jobs- A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality_YY.pdf", "doc_type": "ai_impact_study", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "generative_ai", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 12, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_Generative AI and Jobs- A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality_YY.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "ai_impact_study"}, {"doc_id": "rd_0c52671d716f", "text": "hance labor market information systems, it also poses risks around inclusion, ethics and job security that necessitate judicious governance, capacity building and social dialogue for smooth adoption. Overview of the potential impact of implementing generative AI in Qatar's Labor Market Information System: Background: Qatar's labor market dynamics are rapidly evolving, driven by the nation's economic diversification efforts and its ascent as a global IT and digital hub. As the country charts its vision to transition into a knowledge economy, an opportunity exists to leverage leading-edge technologies like generative AI to further transform and optimize its labor market information systems. Current State: Qatar's expatriate-heavy workforce composition poses talent attraction and retention challenges. With 95% of the IT workforce being non-Qatari, stringent visa regulations make skilled talent recruitment cumbersome. Local graduate availability alone cannot bridge senior-level skills gaps which still require international hiring. Gender imbalance also persists, with women representing just 17% of IT workers.

Hodler & Jim Webber Date: July, 2021 Introduction Knowledge graphs represent entities and their relationships in both human and machine-readable formats to enable reasoning and knowledge discovery by using organizing principles. Key Findings \u30fb Knowledge graphs impose structure and semantics on data through organizing principles like taxonomies and ontologies. This makes data \"smarter\". \u30fb Actioning knowledge graphs focus on driving decisions by integrating, contextualizing, and governing data from across silos. Popular use cases include customer 360, data catalogs, and supply chain optimization. \u30fb Decisioning knowledge graphs apply analytics like algorithms and machine learning to extract insights from graph data. This improves predictions and recommendations. \u30fb Knowledge graphs provide the diverse, contextualized data needed for transparent and accurate AI systems. They also enable transfer learning and explainability. \u30fb Digital twins powered by real-time data use knowledge graphs and AI to create virtual models of systems and processes for monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization. Limitations \u30fb Knowledge graphs require iterative development and should start by solving high-priority use cases with \"just enough\" semantics to prove value. \u30fb Adoption requires changes in processes and mindsets to leverage connected, contextualized data.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_Knowledge Graphs - Data in Context for Responsive Businesses_modified.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_Knowledge Graphs - Data in Context for Responsive Businesses_modified.pdf", "doc_type": "economic_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "knowledge_economy", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 8, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_Knowledge Graphs - Data in Context for Responsive Businesses_modified.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "economic_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_d6e8e88b9aaa", "text": "ment and should start by solving high-priority use cases with \"just enough\" semantics to prove value. \u30fb Adoption requires changes in processes and mindsets to leverage connected, contextualized data. Recommendations \u30fb Start small by incrementally adding structure and semantics to key datasets to address pressing needs. \u30fb Focus initial projects on high-impact challenges like customer 360, data governance, or supply chain resilience. \u30fb Leverage graph analytics and visualizations to uncover insights before incorporating machine learning. \u30fb Reuse existing standards like SKOS, schema.org, and OWL where possible. Conclusion \u30fb Knowledge graphs make data more useful and actionable by connecting it and adding organizational context. \u30fb They power a variety of applications from analytics to AI by revealing contextual insights and patterns. Future Aspects \u30fb Knowledge graphs will be increasingly combined with AI approaches like graph neural networks for sophisticated predictions and decisions. \u30fb Adoption will accelerate as businesses seek to leverage connected data and need transparency for AI systems.

The discovery of oil in the 1940s enabled the development of produc9on and service ac9vi9es requiring labor. The popula9on grew from 0.11 million in the 1970 census to 0.39 million expatriate workers in 2004, driven by demand for workers in sectors like construc9on, services and manufacturing. The adop9on of the Qatar Na9onal Vision 2030 in 2008 and being awarded the 2022 FIFA World Cup in 2010 catalyzed massive investments in infrastructure, triggering another wave of expatriate labor inflow. From just 0.39 million in 2004, the number of expatriate workers doubled to 1.94 million by 2020. - Current State of the Labor Market: As per the 2020 census, 94.4% of Qatar's 2.05 million economically ac9ve popula9on were expatriate workers. The skewed skill composi9on remains a key challenge, with unskilled and semi-skilled workers cons9tu9ng 31.6% of the non-Qatari workforce. The gender ra9o is also highly uneven, with males making up 71% of the total popula9on in 2020. While expatriate workers have been crucial for Qatar's growth, dependence on low-cost foreign labor has led to issues like skills mismatch, low produc9vity, stagnant wages, inadequate working condi9ons and limited labor market governance.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_Qatar Economic Outlook 2021 - 2023 .pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_Qatar Economic Outlook 2021 - 2023 .pdf", "doc_type": "research_report", "source": "R&D Team", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 6, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_Qatar Economic Outlook 2021 - 2023 .pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "research_report"}, {"doc_id": "rd_10f961f462df", "text": "ial for Qatar's growth, dependence on low-cost foreign labor has led to issues like skills mismatch, low produc9vity, stagnant wages, inadequate working condi9ons and limited labor market governance.

However its GDP contribution fell to 7.2% in 2020, the lowest among GCC countries. Despite its previous top GDP contribution in the GCC, it has seen declines as other sectors expanded more rapidly. The Qatar Manufacturing Strategy seeks to rejuvenate this sector, emphasizing pillars such as increasing FDI, aiding SMEs, enhancing finance accessibility, promoting trade, fostering innovation, and nurturing local and international talents. Achieving growth necessitates the localization of essential skills and jobs. Six other sectors - Finance, Professional/Scientific Activities, Tourism, Logistics, Communications, and Manufacturing- are also recognized for economic diversification. The strategy further intends to bolster growth in sub-sectors like pharmaceuticals, agriculture, food processing, chemicals, machinery, and medical supplies, with a strong emphasis on both local and international human capital, as reflected in the In-Country Value concept.

The research also forecasts the GDP impact of closing skills gaps in areas like pharmaceuticals and uses specific estimation techniques to model the effects of suggested interventions. Key Findings: - A skills gap of over 20,000 workers is projected between 2022-2030. The gap is largest where specialist skills are needed. - The pharmaceutical sub-sector alone could see a gap equivalent to 96% of estimated demand. Meeting this demand could contribute an extra QAR 4.7 billion to GDP by 2030. - Contributing factors include skills mismatches, static education offerings, low female participation (57% vs 87% for males), high economic inactivity especially among women and youth, preference for public sector jobs among nationals, and high reliance on expatriate workers (95% of employment). - Increasing female and youth participation could help close the gap. - Proposed interventions around planning, attracting, and developing talent could close the projected gap.

Enhance private sector incentives and pay to attract nationals: - Financial incentives like wage subsidies have proven successful to an extent in Saudi Arabia for increasing workforce localization in the private sector. (https://ndf.gov.sa/en/fund/hrdf/) - However, these need regular review to keep pace with evolving market dynamics. One- time subsidies may not have a lasting impact unless coupled with initiatives for career growth and skills development. - Ultimately a mix of financial and non-financial incentives is needed, not just pay parity. The emphasis should be on growing a qualified and empowered national workforce. Expand academic programs in priority skills: - Strategically increasing capacity of education programs in skills critical for priority manufacturing subsectors can help bridge talent gaps. - South Korea provides an example of aligning education policies to economic development needs. Qatar can emulate this for targeted disciplines. (https://asiasociety.org/global-cities-education-network/south-korean-education- reforms) - Simply increasing program seats may not be effective.

Strong oversight on actual placement rates and impact is critical. In summary, while the report provides useful recommendations, Qatar can customize its skills initiatives by drawing on global success stories and lessons learned. The keys will be local context adaptation, robust monitoring mechanisms, coordinated efforts between stakeholders, and taking a phased approach. Limitations: -The analysis relies on assumptions, estimates and projections. More primary local data would validate the findings. Conclusions: -Collaboration is imperative to develop vital skills and realize the manufacturing sector's full potential, in line with national strategies.

Phase 1: Concepts for organizing data management and technicalities. - Analyze issues surrounding online job information and analysis methods. Phase 2: Examples and lessons learned from using Big Data applications in developed countries. - Using instances of Big Data implementation in the developed countries of US and Europe coupled with their repercussions. Phase 3: Assessing feasibility and identifying constraints in developing nations. - Assessing suitability and challenges in forthcoming economies like India, Africa and Latin America Phase 4: Appropriate combinations of existing methods and detection of problems and prospects. - Future study questions, benefits for such merger with conventional interviewers, and other considerations. The above four phases suggest strategic application of the method per country situations. 2. Concept and technical aspects of Big Data \u25a0 Definition of Big Data Gartner defines Big Data with these three words \u2013 volume, velocity, and variety, which are now considered as the \u201c4 V\u2019s\u201d. These four Vs include volume, variety, velocity, and value. 1.

The word \u201cfor variety\u201d simply implies the addition of different kinds and forms of data, such as structural data as well as other non-structural data like texts, pictures, videos, and audios. 3. For Velocity, it means that data gets generated and retrieved within seconds while being analyzed simultaneously. 4. Value is what can be mined out of these Big Data in terms of discovery of new ideas and useful decisions. Moreover, truthfulness or trustworthiness (Veracity) is another point that has to be taken into account. Accuracy in analysis can only be achieved with the veracity and reliability data collected since the large amount of data collected is mostly prone to include errors or duplicates. Big Data analysis aims to obtain precise information and inference from enormous datasets by employing machine learning as well as other AI algorithms in real time. Big Data like online job posting is known for its volume, speed as well as diversity of available formats.

First, an appropriate website from which to get online job information should be chosen. Demand trends vary from one job site to another. Therefore, it is necessary to collect job data from different job sites for understanding overall demand trends thoroughly. 2. Subsequently, huge chunks of job textual data are extracted from selected job sites employing APIs or web scrapping and crawler. To cope with such high volumes of unstructured data, automation is necessary. 3. It is essential that pre-processing of collected data takes place. Due to its nature, data preprocessing and cleaning should involve completing of missing data, removal of duplicates, and noise removal because there are so much data for it. This ensures high integrity of data truthfulness and improves data analysis precision. 4.

This ensures high integrity of data truthfulness and improves data analysis precision. 4. Automated extraction of occupational roles and competencies from job texts. For computers to process huge volumes of data that cannot be done manually, unstructured textual data should be structured and normalized. The abovementioned structuring process employs machine learning and ontology. 5. Lastly, the resultant data is converted into indicators associated with occupation, region, time series among others and the analysis report made available to relevant parties, using web dashboards and other means. Appropriate visualizations of the analysis results will be helpful as they are challenging to do a semantic interpretation on. It is necessary for the skill-related vocabulary in the job text to be correctly extracted and defined so as to provide insights on skills from online job vacancies. Nevertheless, fuzzy skill expressions like \u201cdigital skills\u201d and \u201ccommunicative skills\u201d will be useless for the analysis. These skill definition have to cover what constitutes certain skills and knowledge. Thereafter, these thus-defined individual skills should then fit within an integrated skill system, and although the framework of a standard skill classification system like ESCO is a starting point for that, merely applying it is far from resolving the incompatibilities between countries or languages.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 28, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f70b6baade05", "text": "although the framework of a standard skill classification system like ESCO is a starting point for that, merely applying it is far from resolving the incompatibilities between countries or languages. Moreover, the framework needs to be country specified and tailored according to realities of every language region. Construction of an ontology that would cover semantic relations between super ordinate concepts, sub-concepts and related concepts is even more important. It is only through such a method that it could be possible to establish the systematics and semantic connections between the skills. High-quality analysis realization starts with this series of skill definition and semantics being seen as essential preprocessing step. This forms a strong foundation for organizing huge volumes of disorganized data. \u25a0 Significance and Limitations of Online Job Posting \u3010Significance\u3011 - Obtaining Large Amounts of Data at Low Cost With relatively lower costs and effort as compared to traditional surveys, large volume of job data can easily be acquired through automatic collection of online public information. Most importantly, the API linkage facilitates cheap and continuous data collection in real time. - Continuous Acquisition of Baseline Data Having routine data collected enables continuous access to baseline information on periodic basis without conducting special surveys.

This eases generalisation of results. - Identification of Emerging Occupations It is possible to detect emerging occupations at an early stage by making use of machine learning that analyses time-changes series of new occupations\u2019 names appearing in job text. However, this is achievable as the mining method for frequent pattern extraction applies to large volumes of text data. - Understanding Skill Ratios Disaggregating specific hard and soft skills across regions and occupations will make it possible to analyze, in which specific contexts the different skills show up. This is due to newly developed techniques for skills extraction from big texts. - Use for Demand Forecasting Online posted skill frequency data may serve as an input to forecasting future occupational or skill demand with historic series. The accuracy of forecasts is mainly dependent on the use of a lot of real data. \u3010Limitations\u3011 - Discrepancy between the number of jobs and actual market demand In some cases, the number of jobs posted online differs from the actual market demand for jobs.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 7, "total_chunks": 28, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_90872c3d2c20", "text": "of a lot of real data. \u3010Limitations\u3011 - Discrepancy between the number of jobs and actual market demand In some cases, the number of jobs posted online differs from the actual market demand for jobs.

This makes it difficult to assess the impact on supporting industries. - Difficulty in promptly detecting emerging occupations In some cases, it is difficult to assess the impact of emerging occupations on the labor market in a timely manner. - Cost of processing alternative representations and cost of countermeasures against missing, duplicate, and noisy data There is an array of alternative terms that appear in recruitment advertisements, and their pre-processing and normalization is expensive.

This method supplements the existing Cedefop methodology that can detect mid- and long-term changes in the labour market and skills but also identifies both cyclical short-term fluctuations and mid- and long-term changes in these domains. - Segment analysis based on the European Classification of Industries and Occupations (NACE/ESCO): It can retrieve trends of a job in an occupation segment or from an industrial basis to find jobs that are posted online using a connection between the NACE and ESCO standard classification to the job postings. - Analysis by region (NUTS): By applying NUTS (National Units of land Survey and Planning), which are common regional classifications in Europe, we can make comparisons between regions within a country, and conduct cross-country analysis.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 9, "total_chunks": 28, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_219ce7a3a7a4", "text": "g NUTS (National Units of land Survey and Planning), which are common regional classifications in Europe, we can make comparisons between regions within a country, and conduct cross-country analysis. - Matching with the results of the European Skills and Occupations Survey: Combining them with those from the previous survey will yield comparative results. This helps fill in any gaps and provides a wider understanding of the labor market when used alongside conventional survey outcomes. It is promising especially when it comes to real-time performance as well as how fragmented the system can be. However, this creates problems with the complexity of data cleaning and analysis processes. Moreover it has a high risk of data bias and is complimented with conventional surveys. As such, using it as a credible single source is an issue right now. 3. Case Studies in Developed Countries \u25a0 Summary of practices in developed countries (Austria, Netherlands, Canada) \u3010Australia\u3011 The PES (the Public Employment Service ) in Austria enlisted Textkernel to analyze employment statistics, and executed a pilot study on AI to verify as well as extend its competency categorizing technique.

This is a clear indication that the taxonomy used has a very significant difference with the field\u2019s language. In addition, there was a negative correlation as the top ten most frequently repeated words were short and transversal in nature while the lengthier they became lesser did their use become. This underpinning highlights the importance of being concise when creating taxonomy term definitions as well as improving user friendliness of NLP system. On the other hand, thanks to the project we managed to employ AI technology for auto- extracting 1,900 particular newly discovered words which would have otherwise been missed by a manual inspection. The process ended with the addition of seventy-nine new words to the taxonomy, confirming a high impact of automatic AI support.

The classification is composed of five skills groupings which include fundamental, analytical, and technical; and seven holistic categories. One can comprehensively comprehend the necessary skills of the occupation by mapping this against the NOC\u2019s occupational profile.

Case Studies in Developing Countries \u25a0 LinkedIn's Potential Use for Big Data Analysis LinkedIn is one of the most popular professional social networks with more than 330 million users worldwide and exceptional information about the demand-side of labour market. It is distinct from other such platforms, most notably because its members disclose extensive information such as employment history, abilities, and training. People put very specific data concerning their employment record, professional competences, qualifications, etc. 1. The profile information is updated in real time. The flexibility of the labor market as it responds to technological changes is constantly measured by looking at member\u2019s records that are being updated and revised frequently since they constantly show changes in the workplace or in job skills.

A huge amount of data allows one to provide qualitative analyses of labor market tendencies. Researchers could use this dataset, among other things, as a point of reference for the development of evidence-informed policies aimed at measuring current growth occupations and transition potential between jobs/occupations. Such characteristics make LinkedIn data a credible information basis for policy making and skill development programs. This includes identification of the mismatch between supply and demand and analysis the possibility of transition between occupations.

This calls for collaboration between the public and private sectors. 5. Combination with Other Data Sources Various attempts are currently being made to combine Big Data with other data sources. The reasons for this are discussed below. Skill demand analysis using Big Data (and especially online job data) has proven to be an effective and valid strategy. This can include examples of limitations like low internet penetration in developing countries. However, traditional survey data also carry their own limitations. Regular surveys are difficult to conduct among developing countries due to quality assurance constraints. Scholars have highlighted the inflexibility inherent within skills mapping in even the developed nations. Thus, the two could combine to offer a joint and credible evaluation that would be more useful.

It started with a country case study and skills development survey in 32 countries on how economic activity and skills influenced policy. Next, we used EXIOBASE, a quantitative computational model capable of analyzing inter-industry trade in 44 countries, to estimate changes in demand for skills by occupation under two scenarios: toward energy sustainability and circular economy transition. Thereafter, we leveraged on related U.S. online job information to discover \u201ctransferable skills\u201d among occupations as also particular skill adjustments required within development fields.

As such, we used U.S. job data as a proxy and estimated the changes in skills demands in four manufacturing recovery states. We were then able to bridge the information insufficiencies in various developing nations and establish the real nature of skills needed. \u3010Case Study 3\u3011: Joint research between ILO and OECD This study aimed to develop a global skill demand shortage/surplus index based on the combination of skills demand index by job vacancies data and labour force survey data.

However, the quantitative model enabled the quantifying of effect under the policy scenario. The combination enabled the investigation from various angles such as analyzing the status quo and making predictions the future prospects. We were also able to understand more detailed changes on skills by using job data. The deficiency of information of developing countries was supplemented by data on skilled change reflecting actual conditions from developed countries in this program for case 2.

In turn, Case 2 enabled us to measure a novel association between job alterations and shift in skills in the manufacturing sector. Important also was our ability to determine needed skills due to shifting of demand. Importantly, in Case 3 we succeeded in getting an index enabling comparison of the mismatch between skill demands and labor forces on a global scale. 6. Conclusion \u25a0 Significance and Limitations of Labor Market Information Surveys Using Big Data \u3010Significance\u3011 - Complementary clarification of non-capturable changes through skills demand trends recognition from actual job data in real time./ - Given these limitations on internet penetration in developing economies, at best, missing information on labour markets could serve as an alternate means for this purpose and assist in prediction of skills needed. - Such an analysis would be beneficial as it will relate skill requirements with occupations and qualification included in the job openings thus providing the necessary information required for formulation of policies.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf", "doc_type": "skills_analysis", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "skills_gap", "chunk_index": 24, "total_chunks": 28, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_The feasibility of using big data  in anticipating and matching skills needs.pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "skills_analysis"}, {"doc_id": "rd_c3bcebe5aaa2", "text": "would be beneficial as it will relate skill requirements with occupations and qualification included in the job openings thus providing the necessary information required for formulation of policies. \u3010Limitations\u3011 - The nature of the job postings may not fully reflect the actual situation because the skill requirements for low-skilled occupations can only be fully understood. - The number of job postings in developing countries is limited because of the lack of Internet access, so there is a limit to the amount of information that can be used as a substitute. - Due to privacy protection considerations, the possibility of using Big Data for administrative purposes remains an issue.

However, the net job loss/gain figure is overly simplistic. The real picture is more nuanced. Governments, companies and individuals all need to understand the shifts to plan for the future. BCG collaborated with Faethm to analyze the impact of technologies on jobs in the US, Germany and Australia. They developed detailed scenarios modeling workforce supply based on demographics, and demand using economic growth and technology adoption projections. The analysis looks at disaggregated effects to see the full picture beyond just net job loss/gain. Methods: The analysis categorizes jobs into 22 job family groups and 80-90 more granular job families. Workforce supply is modeled based on entries (graduates, migration) and exits (retirement, mortality). Demand is modeled based on economic growth and technology impacts. Two COVID-19 GDP impact scenarios were used - a baseline and a more severe projection. Technology impact was modeled using 3 adoption rates - high, medium and low.

The US could see a computer/math shortfall of 6.1M by 2030. - Office and production roles will see surpluses as they are automated. In the US, office and admin support surplus could reach 3M by 2030. - Looking across all job families, the US could face a cumulative shortage of 17.6M in the baseline scenario by 2030. Germany may face a shortage of 3M. - Germany's aging population and low birth rate will exacerbate shortages, as demand is constant/rising but supply will fall. - Australia may see an overall surplus of up to 0.8M in severe pandemic scenarios, due to immigration cuts increasing supply short-term. But skills mismatches will remain. - Faster technology adoption worsens shortages in some roles as demand increases, while slowing adoption lessens the impact. - Beyond job losses, automation enables more strategic human roles as repetitive tasks are automated. - Soft skills like creativity and emotional intelligence will become more valuable as they are harder to automate.

Relevance to Qatar's LMIS 1. Qatar labor market background summary: I. Qatar's Economic and Population Overview: - Qatar has undergone rapid growth but has a small native population, requiring an expatriate workforce that comprises 90% of the total population and labor force. This expatriate population primarily consists of low-wage migrant workers from South/Southeast Asia. Source1, Source2 II. Work in Qatar: - The labor market has a dichotomy between the public sector dominated by well- paid citizens, and the private sector relying majorly on temporary low-wage expat labor. This has created challenges around workforce nationalization and wage disparity. Source1, Source2 III. Issues with Qatar's Workforce: - Additional issues include skills mismatches with many expats lacking higher-value skills. High expat turnover also inhibits workforce development. Migrant dependence has led to workers' rights issues around fees, living conditions, wages and mobility.

While this resource-driven model enabled rapid development for Qatar, there is recogniRon that dependence on finite oil and gas reserves may not be sustainable in the long run. - Challenges Facing the Qatari Labor Market: The Qatari labor market faces structural challenges such as shortage of adequate local workforce, overreliance on expatriate workers, lack of incenRves and opportuniRes for entrepreneurship, and need for development of human capital. Local workers exhibit a preference for public sector jobs due to high salaries and benefits. The private sector is dominated by expatriate workers who comprise nearly 85% of the workforce. Lack of adequate skills, training and incenRves constrain the development of local entrepreneurship. Objec0ves: Against this backdrop, Qatar has taken steps to transiRon towards a knowledge-based economy (KBE) in line with its NaRonal Vision 2030. A KBE is one where growth is driven by knowledge, innovaRon, technology and human capital rather than natural resources.", "source": "R&D Report: Summary_What Are the Binding Constraints for a Knowledge-Based Economy in Qatar_ .pdf", "metadata": {"filename": "Summary_What Are the Binding Constraints for a Knowledge-Based Economy in Qatar_ .pdf", "doc_type": "ai_impact_study", "source": "R&D Team", "topic": "generative_ai", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 5, "file_path": "R&D team summaries and reports\\Summary_What Are the Binding Constraints for a Knowledge-Based Economy in Qatar_ .pdf"}, "freshness": "2025-11-26", "doc_type": "ai_impact_study"}, {"doc_id": "rd_f8cda8219f2e", "text": "towards a knowledge-based economy (KBE) in line with its NaRonal Vision 2030.

This study aimed to systemaRcally idenRfy the binding constraints on building a KBE in Qatar using the framework of new insRtuRonal economics theory. It uRlized data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor to compare Qatar's performance on key indicators of a KBE relaRve to 13 other countries. Methodology: The study adopted a qualitaRve approach to compare Qatar with selected countries across four dimensions of new insRtuRonal economics - culture, insRtuRons, governance and markets. This diagnosRc framework enabled the idenRficaRon of Qatar's strengths and weaknesses in developing a KBE ecosystem. The methodology is robust as it benchmarks Qatar against countries across income levels and geographic regions using established KBE metrics. Key Findings: 1. Qatar scores above average on cultural, insRtuRonal, governance and market factors compared to other countries. This indicates a decent foundaRon for KBE exists. 2.
