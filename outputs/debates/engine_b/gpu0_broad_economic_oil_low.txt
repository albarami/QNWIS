### Final Answer: Prioritize the Advanced Logistics & Trade Hub

**Reasoning:**
1. **Geographic Advantage:** Qatar's strategic location between Europe, Asia, and Africa makes it an ideal hub for trade and logistics. Expanding Hamad International Airport's cargo capacity can create jobs and generate revenue from logistics and re-export activities.
2. **Alignment with Vision 2030:** The Advanced Logistics & Trade Hub aligns with Qatar's goals to diversify its economy, create jobs, and enhance its global trade position. This initiative supports the targets for knowledge economy share, STEM graduates, and youth skills development.
3. **Competitive Advantage:** While Saudi Arabia's NEOM project poses competition, Qatar's existing infrastructure and strategic location provide a solid foundation to become a key player in the global logistics and re-export business.
4. **Investment and Revenue Potential:** The Advanced Logistics & Trade Hub offers a clearer path to generating revenue through trade activities, while the Financial Services Hub faces significant competition from Dubai, making it a more uncertain choice.

**Conclusion:**
Prioritizing the Advanced Logistics & Trade Hub as the primary economic diversification focus for the next decade aligns with Qatar's strategic location, has the potential to generate significant revenue, and creates jobs in the logistics and trade sectors. This option aligns with Qatar's goals to diversify its economy, create jobs, and enhance its global trade position.
