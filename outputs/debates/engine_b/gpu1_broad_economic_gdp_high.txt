**Final Answer:**

**Priority: Advanced Logistics & Trade Hub (Option B)**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Alignment with Strong GDP Growth:**
   - Strong GDP growth at 5% annually indicates a growing economy that could benefit from improved logistics and trade capabilities to support further expansion.

2. **Geographic Advantage:**
   - Qatar's strategic position between Europe, Asia, and Africa makes it an ideal location for a logistics and trade hub. Expanding Hamad Airport's cargo capacity can help Qatar become a key transit point for goods moving between these regions.

3. **Infrastructure Investment:**
   - Expanding Hamad Airport's cargo capacity and improving logistics infrastructure could yield faster returns and create more jobs in the short term, aligning with the strong GDP growth.

4. **Competition Considerations:**
   - While Dubai is a major player in financial services, Qatar can differentiate itself in the logistics sector by leveraging its strategic location and investing in efficient supply chains, making it a key player in the GCC's logistics scene.

5. **Risk and Opportunity Balance:**
   - Option B offers a more immediate impact due to the need for efficient logistics capabilities, while Option A faces high competition from Dubai and requires longer-term investments to achieve desired market share.

**Conclusion:**
Prioritizing the Advanced Logistics & Trade Hub aligns with Qatar's strong GDP growth, leverages its strategic location, and provides a more immediate impact on the economy through job creation and enhanced trade capabilities.
