## 🌐 OPEN YOUR BROWSER NOW

### Frontend is running at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

**IMPORTANT:** It's on **port 3000** now (not 3001)

### Backend still running at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## 🧪 TEST IT NOW - 2 OPTIONS

### Option 1: Simple Query Test (15 seconds)

**Go to:** http://localhost:3000

**Type:**
```
What is Qatar's unemployment rate?
```

**Click:** "Submit to Intelligence Council"

**You'll see:**
- ✅ classify → prefetch → rag → synthesize (4 stages)
- ✅ Fast path (skips agents)
- ✅ Answer in ~15 seconds

---

### Option 2: Complex Query - See EVERYTHING (25 minutes)

**Type:**
```
Should Qatar invest QAR 50B in renewable energy or LNG expansion? Analyze job creation and economic diversification.
```

**Click:** "Submit to Intelligence Council"

**You'll NOW see:**

**Stages 1-3: Data Collection (10s)**
- ✅ Classify (instant)
- ✅ Prefetch (5s - loads 158 facts from APIs)
- ✅ RAG (2s)

**Stage 4: Scenario Generation (30s)** ← NEW!
- ✅ Generates 6 scenarios with Claude Sonnet 4
- ✅ Shows scenario cards:
  1. Base Case
  2. Oil Price Shock
  3. GCC Competition
  4. Digital Disruption
  5. Belt and Road
  6. Regional Integration

**Stage 5: Parallel Execution (20-25 min)** ← NEW!
- ✅ Each scenario runs on separate GPU (0-5)
- ✅ Each gets full analysis:
  - MicroEconomist
  - MacroEconomist
  - Nationalization
  - SkillsAgent
  - PatternDetective
  - 30-turn legendary debate
  - GPU fact verification
  - Synthesis
- ✅ Shows progress for all 6

**Stage 6: Meta-Synthesis (30s)** ← NEW!
- ✅ Claude aggregates all 6 scenarios
- ✅ Shows:
  - **Robust Recommendations** (work in ALL scenarios)
  - **Scenario-Dependent Strategies** (IF oil shock THEN...)
  - **Key Uncertainties** (what could change outcomes)
  - **Early Warning Indicators** (how to detect shifts)
  - **Final Strategic Guidance** (what to do NOW)

**Stage 7: Done**
- ✅ Complete ministerial brief
- ✅ All scenario results available

---

## 📊 WHAT YOU'LL GET

### The Output Will Include:

**1. Scenario Analysis Section (NEW!)**
```
🎯 Parallel Scenario Analysis (6 scenarios)

Cards showing each scenario:
- Base Case: Current economic trends continue
- Oil Price Shock: Oil drops to $40/barrel
- GCC Competition: UAE/Saudi intensify talent war
- Digital Disruption: AI/automation accelerates
- Belt and Road: Chinese investment surge
- Regional Integration: GCC coordination fails
```

**2. Meta-Synthesis Section (NEW!)**
```
🎓 Cross-Scenario Meta-Synthesis

✅ Robust Recommendations (Work in ALL Scenarios):
  - Recommendation 1 that works regardless of future
  - Recommendation 2 that's resilient
  - etc.

⚡ Scenario-Dependent Strategies (IF-THEN Logic):
  - IF oil prices collapse THEN diversify aggressively
  - IF GCC competition intensifies THEN wage premiums
  - etc.

⚠️ Key Uncertainties:
  - What drives outcome differences across scenarios

🚨 Early Warning Indicators:
  - Metrics to monitor for scenario shifts
```

**3. Individual Scenario Details**
- Expandable cards with each scenario's findings
- Confidence scores
- Key insights

**4. Executive Summary**
- Final ministerial brief
- Aggregated recommendations
- Confidence scores
