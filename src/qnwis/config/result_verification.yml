# Result Verification Configuration (Step-20)
# Tolerances and rules for numeric claim verification

# Rounding tolerances
rounding:
  # Absolute epsilon for integer counts
  abs_epsilon: 0.5
  # Relative epsilon for larger values (1% tolerance)
  rel_epsilon: 0.01

# Percentage-specific rules
percent:
  # Epsilon for percentage rounding (0.5% tolerance)
  epsilon_pct: 0.5
  # Check that percentage groups sum to ~100
  sum_to_100: true

# Currency rules
currency:
  # Supported currency codes
  currencies:
    - QAR
    - USD
  # Absolute epsilon for currency amounts (±50 allowed if rounded)
  epsilon_amount: 50

# Claim binding strategy
binding:
  # Prefer exact query_id match over source_family
  prefer_query_id: true
  # Require citation prefix before attempting verification
  require_citation_first: true
  # Ignore numbers below this threshold
  ignore_numbers_below: 1.0
  # Segment-aware binding (restrict to matching rows when sentence mentions label)
  segment_fields:
    - sector
    - industry
    - company
    - employer
    - segment
    - country

# Allowed citation prefixes (reused from Step-19)
allowed_prefixes:
  - "Per LMIS:"
  - "According to GCC-STAT:"
  - "According to World Bank:"

# Derived claim consistency checks
derived:
  derived_share_check_enabled: true
  derived_share_min_components: 2

# Performance limits
performance:
  # Maximum runtime for verification (seconds)
  max_runtime_sec: 5
