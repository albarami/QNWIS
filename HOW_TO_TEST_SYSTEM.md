- ✅ Returns answer in ~15 seconds

---

### 2. Medium Query (Full Analysis - 20 minutes)

**Type in frontend:**
```
Analyze Qatar's labor market trends over the past 5 years
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Classified as MEDIUM or COMPLEX
- ✅ All 10 nodes execute
- ✅ 12 agents analyze (4 agent nodes shown in grid)
- ✅ 30-turn legendary debate (watch it stream live!)
- ✅ GPU fact verification on GPU 6
- ✅ Devil's advocate critique
- ✅ Ministerial synthesis
- ✅ Takes ~20 minutes

**What to watch for:**
- Real-time agent cards updating in UI

### 3. Complex Strategic Query (Parallel Scenarios - 25 minutes)

**Type in frontend:**
```
Should Qatar invest $50B in a financial technology hub or logistics hub? Analyze job creation potential and economic impact.
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Classified as COMPLEX
- ✅ 6 scenarios generated by Claude Sonnet 4:
  1. Base Case
  2. Oil Price Shock
  3. GCC Competition Intensifies
  4. Digital Disruption
  5. Belt and Road Acceleration
  6. Demographic Dividend
- ✅ Each scenario runs on separate GPU (0-5) IN PARALLEL
- ✅ Each gets full 12-agent analysis + 30-turn debate
- ✅ Meta-synthesis aggregates all 6 scenarios
- ✅ Returns robust recommendations + scenario strategies
- ✅ Takes ~25 minutes (vs 2+ hours if sequential!)

**GPU Activity:**
- GPU 0-5: Running 6 debates simultaneously
- GPU 6: Verifying facts in real-time
- GPU 7: Reserved

- **Phase 6:** Final Synthesis

Real conversation turns stream live!

### Results Panel (Bottom Section)
- **Executive Summary:** TL;DR for ministers
- **Recommendations:** Top 3 actions

## 🔍 BACKEND FEATURES TO VERIFY

### Check Health Status
```bash
# In PowerShell or browser
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Should show:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "gpus": 8,
  "agents": 12,
  "fact_verification": "ready",
  "parallel_scenarios": "enabled",
  "documents_indexed": 130
}
```

### Check API Documentation
```
Open: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

**Explore:**
- `POST /api/v1/council/stream` - Main streaming endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

---

## 📊 MONITORING (Optional)

### Real-Time Monitoring

**Open 3 additional terminals and run:**

**Terminal 1: GPU Monitoring**
```bash
cd D:\lmis_int
python monitoring/monitor_gpus.py
```
Watch GPU 0-6 memory and utilization in real-time

**Terminal 2: API Health**
```bash
cd D:\lmis_int
python monitoring/monitor_api.py
```
Monitor API health and latency

**Terminal 3: Dashboard**
```bash
cd D:\lmis_int
python monitoring/dashboard.py
```
Real-time system dashboard (refreshes every 5s)

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Frontend Won't Connect to Backend

**Check CORS:**
Backend allows `http://localhost:3001` by default.

**Check Backend Health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Should return: `"status": "healthy"`

### If Queries Are Slow

**Normal behavior:**
- Simple queries: 15-30s
- Complex queries: 15-25 minutes (30-turn debate takes time!)
- Parallel scenarios: 20-30 minutes

**The 30-turn debate is REAL and DEEP - it's supposed to take time!**

### If You Want to Stop Servers

**Stop Backend:**
```bash
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*python*"} | Stop-Process -Force
```

**Stop Frontend:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the frontend terminal
# Or find the node process and stop it
```
